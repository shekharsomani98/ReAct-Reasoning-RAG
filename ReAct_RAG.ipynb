            "            Context: ['The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried is likely to be more consequential than just whether the man himself is found guilty. Depending on what evidence is introduced during the trial, it could be rough for the entire crypto industry.\\n\\n“How much damage can this trial do to the already beaten-down reputation of the industry at this point?” asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. “This trial is going to be an excruciating moment for the industry because no one knows what kind of evidence might come out.”\\n\\nBankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, is facing seven counts of criminal charges: two counts of wire fraud, and five counts of conspiracy charges. FTX was a failed cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019. According to a now-deleted profile from FTX investors Sequoia Capital, FTX was founded because of Bankman-Fried’s frustration with other exchanges when he was running Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm. According to the SEC, FTX was a fraud “from the start,” diverting customers’ funds to Alameda.\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud “from the start,” the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges — with a “multi-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.” Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\\n\\n“Really just old-fashioned embezzlement.”\\n\\nWhat’s left of FTX is now being led by John J. Ray III — you may remember him as the guy who cleaned up Enron and who also said FTX is worse than Enron. Just before the trial began, the FTX lawyers filed suit against Bankman-Fried’s parents, saying they should give back millions of dollars they got from their kid. Ray has also referred to Bankman-Fried’s conduct as “really just old-fashioned embezzlement.”\\n\\nWe have some inkling of what the government will be arguing thanks to the filings prosecutors are making in this case. They argue that Bankman-Fried lied about consumer protection and that Bankman-Fried’s statements that FTX was “avoiding or managing conflicts of interest” and that “as a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms” were lies, in a superseding indictment filed August 14th.\\n\\nThe indictment also says that there were special features in FTX’s code that “permitted Alameda to spend and withdraw unlimited amounts of money from FTX,” which were created at Bankman-Fried’s direction. That effectively exempted Alameda from the kinds of risk management other customers faced. At the same time, the government alleges, “Bankman-Fried publicly and repeatedly asserted that Alameda did not have privileged access to FTX.”\\n\\nBankman-Fried is accused of using “billions of dollars in misappropriated FTX customer deposits” to help buy more than $200 million of real estate for himself, make billions of dollars of investments for his own interest, and repay Alameda’s lenders, according to the indictment, Additionally, Bankman-Fried allegedly used more than $100 million of customer funds to make political contributions; prosecutors can show evidence of those contributions in this trial, even though they aren’t part of the charges brought. A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, with additional charges.\\n\\nBefore his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto — the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry. He was also very interested in publicity, sitting for many interviews both before and after the fall of FTX. The quick rise of FTX as an industry force was at least in part due to Bankman-Fried’s appetite for attention. Here are the hits:\\n\\nBankman-Fried gave interviews freely — and quickly rose to public prominence in the industry. Though FTX hadn’t been in the business as long as competing exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, Bankman-Fried positioned himself as an important, boyish face for crypto. (At one point, Bankman-Fried told a colleague at FTX that “I honestly think it’s negative EV [this may mean “expected value,” as in poker] for me to cut my hair. I think it’s important for people to think I look crazy.”)\\n\\nBecause he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals. Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial — the part where the government must prove intent.\\n\\nThe first part of proving the government’s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place. Whatever records the Southern District of New York has for the transactions will be shown.\\n\\n“What conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?”\\n\\nThe second part is where all the drama is likely to come, says Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner and co-chair of the cryptocurrency practice at the law firm Withers. Prosecutors have to connect those transactions to Bankman-Fried, show that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and prove that he lied about it anyway.\\n\\n“What was he saying to his parents and his other advisors about this?” LaVigne says. “What conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?”\\n\\nTo further establish intent, the government can use Bankman-Fried’s own words. The indictment calls Bankman-Fried’s tweets in November 2022 “false and misleading.”\\n\\n“We had him going out directly to the internet,” LaVigne says. If he wrote things on Twitter or said things in interviews that weren’t true, that’s more fodder for the government’s case. “They can point to that and say, ‘This is what he said, this is what actually happened.’”\\n\\nOther evidence may include Signal messages and testimony from co-conspirators who plead guilty to their own charges. Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who was also sometimes Bankman-Fried’s girlfriend, may play an important role — Bankman-Fried leaked her diaries to The New York Times and was consequently jailed for witness tampering. The government has indicated FTX co-founder Gary Wang and engineering head Nishad Singh will also be among the witnesses called to give testimony about Bankman-Fried.\\n\\nBankman-Fried’s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him\\n\\nThere may be testimony from lenders, venture capitalists, and customers in order to establish the basis for some charges. In the indictment, the prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried lied to FTX investors. Some of those investors may be called on to testify, which is not the kind of thing VC big shots generally enjoy — and which might create collateral damage for the industry.\\n\\nIf, for instance, Sequoia Capital did due diligence around its investment in FTX, whatever Bankman-Fried told its partners could be important. Was FTX already sending Alameda customer funds at that point? Did Bankman-Fried know about it? And did he tell VCs at the time? (If he told them it wasn’t happening, that would establish intent.) Binance was also an early investor in FTX, and former executives may be called on to testify as well, says Hermine Wong, the former head of policy at Coinbase and a former SEC regulator.\\n\\nBankman-Fried’s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him. Defense lawyers have several simultaneous objectives. First and foremost, they’re trying to prove their client is not guilty. But just in case they don’t get the outcome they want, they’re also laying the groundwork for appeals and sentencing arguments. Any piece of evidence they want to introduce for those two purposes has to come into play in the trial.\\n\\nAlready, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers are marking arguments that his constitutional rights are being violated by his pretrial incarceration because, among other things, his internet connection wasn’t good enough for him to plan his defense, notes LaVigne. That could be grounds for an appeal.\\n\\n“Is he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?”\\n\\nBankman-Fried’s behavior after the fall of FTX suggests he’s something of a wild card. He may suggest he was acting on the advice of his lawyers. But he may also introduce other evidence that could be troublesome — implying, for instance, that he was engaged in standard industry behavior or that everything that happened was Binance’s fault. That may be risky, but we already know that Bankman-Fried loves risk.\\n\\n“Is he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?” Wong asks. “An idea like, ‘Everyone was doing this, it’s not fair I’m the only one who was charged?’” That may not fly in a court of law, but it could absolutely damage public perception of crypto at large.\\n\\nFor instance, just before he was arrested, Bankman-Fried brought forward messages from a crypto group chat in testimony he planned to give before Congress. In that testimony, he primarily blames Binance and his lawyers at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell.\\n\\nIt’s possible other messages from group chats may be brought into evidence during the trial. That can potentially be embarrassing for the whole industry, Wong says.\\n\\n“You can imagine some of these founders, CEOs, people of that echelon talk to each other somewhat informally about what’s going on,” she says. If it seems like his peer group supported him, or worse, fawned over him, that’s a real problem for the industry’s reputation.”\\n\\nAfter FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried went on an extensive media tour, doing interviews with The New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin and Good Morning America. Even under house arrest, he did interviews, including with The New Yorker. Bankman-Fried seemed to think that if he just explained things, everyone would understand that what he did was a mistake, not a crime.', 'I’ve got some shitty ex-boyfriends, but none of them made me the CEO of their sin-eater hedge fund while refusing to give me equity and bragging about how there was a 5 percent chance they’d become the president of the United States, you know? Absolutely counting my blessings after Caroline Ellison’s first day on the stand. I wonder how many of the nine women on the jury are doing the same.\\n\\nEllison was the head of Alameda Research, the aforementioned hedge fund, during the implosion of it and FTX. She’s already pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from one of the worst romantic relationships I’ve ever heard of, and her testimony was widely anticipated before the trial. Today, that took the form of discussing a damning spreadsheet — one she prepared for her ex and boss Sam Bankman-Fried, now the defendant in a criminal fraud trial.\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud “from the start,” the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges — with a “multi-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.” Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\\n\\nThe day started off promisingly for the defense as it cross-examined Gary Wang, the chief technology officer of FTX and co-owner of both FTX and Alameda. Christian Everdell, one of Bankman-Fried’s defense attorneys, couldn’t undo the damage of last week’s code review. But he managed to shake the rust off long enough to make Wang sound less reliable, drowning the jury in confusing technicalities.\\n\\nLast week, Wang testified that Alameda got access to a special credit line and an option to take its balance into the negative without triggering liquidation — something he alleged other accounts at FTX didn’t get. Everdell tried to undermine this claim by talking about the spot margin program, which let users lend each other assets for margin trading. In those cases, it was possible to have a negative balance in a specific coin. It was not, however, possible for those accounts to avoid liquidation, as Wang testified Alameda could do — or to have an overall negative balance. But I’m betting the defense is hoping the jurors will throw up their hands in confusion thinking about this.\\n\\n“We ultimately took about $14 billion, some of which we were not able to pay back.”\\n\\nWang didn’t exactly help himself out, either. Apparently, what Wang said in court contradicted something he’d said in earlier interviews with the government about market making. I say “apparently” because Everdell was probably giving him his previous testimony to refresh his recollection, but Wang was insisting he didn’t remember. In any event, whatever Wang was shown wasn’t submitted as evidence or shown to the court. I got the gist, though, and I bet the jury did, too — probably the strongest work the defense has done so far.\\n\\nBut by the end of the day, that all seemed like a sideshow. Bankman-Fried had been vibrating slightly during Wang’s testimony. During Ellison’s testimony, his bouncing became more noticeable.\\n\\nEllison was hunched in on herself as she walked into the courtroom, wearing a dusty rose dress with a gray blazer over it, looking less like an executive than like a girl who’s borrowed her boyfriend’s coat because she’s cold. When the prosecution asked her to identify Bankman-Fried, she had trouble finding him and gazed around the courtroom for more than 20 seconds — apparently he was incognito with his new haircut. After she did spot him, she was asked to identify him, which she did by identifying him as wearing a suit. This got chuckles from the rest of the defense table, also all in suits.\\n\\nShe listed off the crimes she’d already pleaded guilty to and added that Bankman-Fried “directed me to commit these crimes,” Ellison said. (Fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, and money laundering, in case you were wondering.) “We ultimately took about $14 billion, some of which we were not able to pay back.” She tilted her head down to answer the questions, then lifted her head when she’d finished her answer.\\n\\nBankman-Fried called this being “risk-neutral,” which seems like a fancy way of saying he was a gambling addict\\n\\nIn Ellison’s telling, Alameda was troubled from her earliest time there in 2018. “Shortly after I started, I learned the company was in worse shape than I realized,” Ellison said. Alameda had initially been funded with loans “from acquaintances,” she said, and those loans were recalled a few weeks after she arrived. (There was a staff revolt within Alameda Research over lost millions and general financial chaos, according to Michael Lewis’ Going Infinite.) Ellison asked Bankman-Fried why he hadn’t shared the company’s shaky circumstances in the job offer. “He hadn’t known how to tell me,” she said.\\n\\nEllison was also, of course, in a more personal relationship with Bankman-Fried. (A juror who’d been asleep for a discussion of the FTT token woke up when she started discussing it.) The two started sleeping together in the fall of 2018, on and off. At the time, she was a trader and Bankman-Fried was the CEO. They didn’t date until later — twice. Their first relationship stretched from the summer of 2020 through the summer of 2021; they agreed to keep it secret. (Some people found out, as they usually do.) The second time, from the fall of 2021 until the spring of 2022, they lived together.\\n\\nThat gave Ellison an unusual view of his character. “He was very ambitious,” she said. Besides telling her about his presidential chances, he also told her that if there was a coin flip where tails destroyed the world and heads made the world twice as good, he’d flip the coin. He called this being “risk-neutral,” which seems like a fancy way of saying he was a gambling addict.\\n\\nShe was named co-CEO of Alameda with Sam Trabucco in 2021, while she and Bankman-Fried were broken up, and CEO in 2022. The goal, Bankman-Fried told her, was to “optically” separate Alameda Research and FTX. “The whole time we were dating, he was my boss at work,” she said. They broke up because she wanted more from the relationship; Bankman-Fried was distant and not paying enough attention to her.\\n\\nUsing the effectively unlimited funds “allowed us to make profitable trades we couldn’t have made otherwise”\\n\\nBankman-Fried didn’t grant Ellison equity, even though she asked; he told her it would be too complicated. Instead, she got a $200,000 salary, even as CEO, and bonuses twice a year, which ranged from $100,000 to $20 million.\\n\\nInitially, Alameda and FTX were “very integrated,” Ellison said. They were run by the same team, from the same office. And when Alameda was scrounging for funds, Bankman-Fried told Ellison that FTX would be a good source of capital. The $65 billion line of credit Alameda Research had meant that it did not have to post collateral. There was no contract and no written terms, she testified. It also wasn’t visible to FTX’s auditors — she’d raised the question with Bankman-Fried, and he told her not to worry about it.\\n\\nAlameda’s credit line — which was taken in increments of $100,000 to $10 million at a time — was used for trading. Using the effectively unlimited funds “allowed us to make profitable trades we couldn’t have made otherwise,” Ellison testified.\\n\\nCustomer funds were also used when Bankman-Fried bought back FTX shares from Binance, an early investor, in the summer of 2021. Bankman-Fried told Ellison it was “really important,” otherwise “Binance would do things to mess with FTX.” Ellison says she told him Alameda didn’t have the money. So Bankman-Fried took $1 billion of FTX customer funds to buy out Binance, the first time Ellison recalled an amount that large. It was Bankman-Fried’s decision, she said, as he was the CEO of FTX.\\n\\nFTT was one of several “Sam coins”\\n\\nThere was also the FTT token, which was created by Bankman-Fried and Wang. Alameda got its war chest — 60 percent to 70 percent of the initial supply — for free, while seed investors got FTT at 10 cents a coin, and FTT first listed at $1 a coin. Bankman-Fried felt that $1 per coin was psychologically important, Ellison said, and he directed her to buy up FTT using Alameda if its price fell below a dollar.\\n\\nFTT was one of several “Sam coins,” a nickname for tokens that Bankman-Fried was heavily involved in and owned a lot of, either personally or through Alameda. Those coins were almost certainly worth less than the value displayed on the balance sheet because trying to sell them all at once would crater the prices. Bankman-Fried directed her to put those coins on the balance sheets Alameda showed to lenders, even though she felt it was “somewhat misleading.”\\n\\nAlameda was also getting loans from outside lenders, such as Genesis, because when FTX started, there weren’t a lot of customer funds to borrow, Ellison testified. That was the basis of the worst of her testimony — and the spreadsheet from hell.\\n\\nEllison said she’d prepared the spreadsheet at Bankman-Fried’s request in the fall of 2021 and shared it with him. The point was risk analysis around paying back Alameda’s loans if they were abruptly recalled by Genesis, their lender. Bankman-Fried wanted to use $3 billion for venture investments, so Ellison was ballparking what that would do to Alameda’s risk. In the as-is scenario, if things went south, she figured there was a 30 percent chance they wouldn’t be able to meet the loan recalls. If Bankman-Fried used $3 billion to make investments, there was a 100 percent chance they couldn’t meet the recalls, even with FTX customer funds.\\n\\nEchoing Bankman-Fried and Ellison’s romantic relationship, FTX was keeping cozy private ties with Alameda yet publicly holding it at arm’s length\\n\\nThe problem here wasn’t really the math, which seemed pretty arbitrary. It was that Ellison’s calculations assumed Alameda could borrow $1.8 billion in normal dollars and $1.5 billion in crypto from FTX. The spreadsheet makes this clear with a row labeled “FTX borrows,” which Ellison said were customer funds.\\n\\nMeanwhile, echoing Bankman-Fried and Ellison’s romantic relationship, FTX was keeping cozy private ties with Alameda yet publicly holding it at arm’s length. On January 14th, 2022, Bankman-Fried tweeted, “We’re launching a $2b venture fund: FTX Ventures!” Those funds came from Alameda, Ellison testified. But Bankman-Fried didn’t want to go public with the source of the funds. He said he thought Alameda’s brand was less good, and he didn’t want his name associated with it. Alameda also bought Robinhood shares for Bankman-Fried, who moved them to a vehicle called “Emergent Fidelity Technologies” to avoid association with Alameda.\\n\\nThe day ended with a document that had been shared between Ellison and Bankman-Fried — with his comments appearing in bubbles along the main text. Ellison wrote she was worried about “both actual leverage and presenting on our balance sheet.” Bankman-Fried responded with a note: “Yup, and could also get worse.”', 'Witness Adam Yedidia answers questions during Sam Bankman-Fried fraud trial over the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, at Federal Court in New York City, October 5, 2023, in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\\n\\nTwo of Sam Bankman-Fried\\'s former friends from MIT, who also worked at crypto exchange FTX while living with the company\\'s founder in the Bahamas, took the stand in a Manhattan courtroom this week to testify against their former classmate, confidant, and boss — a man who allegedly ran a crypto empire that defrauded thousands of customers out of billions of dollars. Gary Wang, the lesser-known co-founder of FTX, was asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos on Thursday, \"Did you commit financial crimes while working at FTX?\" \"Yes,\" responded Wang. He said that his crimes, including wire and commodities fraud, were carried out with the help of Bankman-Fried, FTX ex-engineering head Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison, who ran sister hedge fund Alameda Research and had been Bankman-Fried\\'s girlfriend. \"Mr. Wang, do you see any of the people you committed those crimes with in the courtroom today?\" Roos continued. Wang, dressed in an oversized and wrinkled suit with a red tie and glasses, awkwardly stood up and looked around the courtroom before responding, \"Yes.\" \"Who do you see?\" asked Roos. \"Sam Bankman-Fried,\" he said. The trial, set to last six weeks, will resume on Tuesday with key testimony expected from Ellison, who is considered the prosecution\\'s star witness, having already pleaded guilty to multiple charges. Bankman-Fried faces seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, that could put him in prison for the rest of his life. Thus far, Bankman-Fried, 31, has remained mostly quiet in court intently listening to witnesses and at times writing notes to his attorneys. But as Wang testified against him, Bankman-Fried looked visibly upset, shifting his gaze from his former friend to the ground, and at one point putting his head in his hands.\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried listens as Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos questions Gary Wang during Bankman-Fried\\'s fraud trial over the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, at Federal Court in New York City, U.S., October 6, 2023, in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\\n\\nWang, 30, was technology chief for FTX, which spiraled into bankruptcy in November. He spoke so fast that U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan and the prosecutor both stopped him at points to ask that he slow his pace. Much of Wang\\'s testimony on Friday focused on the final days at FTX before the entire operation imploded, including reports in the media detailing Alameda\\'s business practices and its troubling ties to FTX. Wang said that in response to the reporting an emergency meeting was called between Bankman-Fried, Wang and Singh, to discuss shutting down Alameda. He said they ultimately decided against such a move, because he and Bankman-Fried were aware that Alameda had no way to repay the roughly $14 billion hole in its books. Prosecutors took the jury through a series of tweets, beginning on Nov. 7. Posts came from the company blaming bank hours for slow withdrawals, while Bankman-Fried tweeted from his personal account, assuring customers that all was fine. \"FTX was not fine and assets were not fine,\" Wang testified. On Nov. 12, after FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried asked Wang to drive with him to the Bahamas Securities Commission for a meeting. On the drive, Bankman-Fried told Wang to transfer assets to Bahamian liquidators because he believed they would allow him to maintain control of the company. Wang said he wasn\\'t in the meeting with the securities authority, though Bankman-Fried\\'s dad was present.\\n\\n\\n\\nWang said he returned to the U.S. and met with prosecutors the next day. He faces up to 50 years in prison when he faces a judge for sentencing following this trial.

Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\\n\\nBorn in China, Wang moved to the U.S. at age 7, and grew up in Minnesota before going to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study math and computer science. He worked at Google after college. Wang, who first met Bankman-Fried during high school at a summer camp, owned 10% of Alameda, while his boss owned the other 90%. Wang told the court about the advantages that Alameda received by having code baked into FTX\\'s software that allowed special access to the crypto exchange. Those privileges ultimately resulted in Alameda owing FTX $8 billion worth of customer deposits. \"We gave special privileges on FTX that gave unlimited withdrawals on the platform to Alameda,\" Wang said. Alameda was allowed to withdraw and transfer those funds and had a $65 billion line of credit. \"When customers deposited USD, it went to Alameda,\" he said. \"It existed in the computer code. Alameda could have negative balances and unlimited withdrawals.\" That \"bug\" in the code was written by Nishad Singh, who was FTX\\'s director of engineering, and reviewed by Wang. Bankman-Fried was calling the shots, Wang said. Wang also told the court about a $1 million personal loan he received and a $200 million to $300 million loan in his name from Alameda that was never deposited into his account, but rather was used to make investments into other companies on behalf of FTX. That was all done by Bankman-Fried, he testified. In early 2020, Wang said he discovered for the first time Alameda\\'s negative balance exceeded FTX\\'s revenue, an indication that Alameda was taking customer funds. Wang said he brought this to Bankman-Fried\\'s attention several times. In late 2021, Wang discovered Alameda had withdrawn $3 billion from its $65 billion line of credit. Wang\\'s compensation was a base salary of $200,000 per year plus stock. He owned roughly 17% of FTX. Even though they were co-founders, \"ultimately it was Sam\\'s decision to make\" when there were disagreements, he said.\\n\\nAssistant United States Attorney Nicolas Roos questions Gary Wang during Sam Bankman-Fried\\'s fraud trial over the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, at Federal Court in New York City, U.S., October 6, 2023, in this courtroom sketch.

Bankman-Fried asked Yedidia if it was a good idea for them to date, to which Yedidia said no. Bankman-Fried responded by saying he was expecting that answer. One of Yedidia\\'s responsibilities was fixing the bug in the code that gave Alameda preferential treatment. In June 2022, he submitted a report to Bankman-Fried on Signal that showed $8 billion in customer money held in an internal database tracking the cash wired to an Alameda account called \"fiat at ftx.com\" was missing. Yedidia said he and Bankman-Fried spoke about it at the pickleball court at the resort in Nassau, Bahamas. He asked his boss if things were OK. He was concerned because it \"seemed like a lot of money\" from FTX customers was at risk. \"Sam said, we were bulletproof last year. We aren\\'t bulletproof this year,\" Yedidia testified. Yedidia said he asked when they would be bulletproof again. Bankman-Fried said he wasn\\'t sure, but it may be six months to three years. Yedidia said Bankman-Fried appeared \"worried or nervous,\" which he said was atypical. Still, Yedidia said he trusted Bankman-Fried and Ellison to \"handle the situation.\" On cross-examination, Christian Everdell, Bankman-Fried\\'s attorney, focused on how Yedidia was the one responsible for developing and reviewing the code.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe asked about the long hours employees worked and Yedidia\\'s concern for Wang being near burnout. That resulted in Yedidia instituting a rule to not wake Wang at night for bug fixes because he needed sleep. Everdell also drilled Yedidia on his high level of compensation in his less than two years at FTX. His base salary was between $175,000 and $200,000, but he received multiple bonuses of more than $12 million in cash and company equity. Yedidia said he\\'s now teaching math — geometry and algebra — at a high school. He invested most of the millions he earned as bonuses back into FTX, and his equity stake is now worthless. As FTX was failing, Yedidia said he was by Bankman-Fried\\'s side. He highlighted a Signal exchange in November 2022, during which he wrote, \"I love you Sam. I\\'m not going anywhere.\" He said he wrote the message because so many people had left. When asked what changed, Yedidia said he learned that FTX customer deposits had been used to pay loans to creditors. He said Alameda\\'s actions seemed \"flagrantly wrong.\" Yedidia\\'s testimony ended on a fiery note, which was later struck from the record. He was asked why he had lost faith in FTX and resigned. \"FTX defrauded all its customers,\" he said.\\n\\nMatt Huang, co-founder of Paradigm Operations LP, right, arrives at court in New York, US, on Thursday, Oct. 5, 2023.

Additionally, he was promised that Alameda had no preferential treatment on the FTX platform, even though the hedge fund was one of its top traders. Huang said he was concerned about FTX\\'s lack of a board of directors, but he eventually invested anyway.

            "            Context: ['Thousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president’s 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4.5 billion. Bloomberg’s calculation has consistently been below Trump’s figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he’s accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his “brand” adds. He also said that banks didn’t rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. “They just weren’t a very important element in banks’ decision-making process,” Trump told the court. “And we’ll explain that as this trial goes along.” Here’s a look at New York state’s valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg’s own approach to assessing the assets.\\n\\nMar-a-Lago Trump’s valuation (2021): $US612.1 million , Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US240 million, New York’s valuation (2021): $US27.6 million It’s fair to say that Trump’s most famous property these days is no longer New York’s Trump Tower but his Mar-a-Lago Club, the historic Palm Beach estate built by Marjorie Merriweather Post in the 1920s that he now calls home. New York’s valuation of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate has raised eyebrows. Credit: AP The sprawling resort has been at the centre of some publicised post-presidency scandals, from classified documents being kept in one of its bathrooms to the location where Trump is said to have shared nuclear submarine secrets with Australian businessman Anthony Pratt — something that Trump denies.\\n\\nIt’s also a major focus in Trump’s fraud lawsuit. Trump made a series of agreements with Palm Beach County and the National Trust for Historic Preservation for Mar-a-Lago to be used only as a club, giving up any development rights. Consequently, Palm Beach values the property as a business on its tax rolls. In 2021, the county assessed it at $US27.6 million, lower than comparable residential properties. New York State argues that this appraisal is the one Trump should have been using. New York’s estimated value “was a shock to the real estate community and anybody with any understanding of the island and its values,” said Liza Pulitzer, a real estate agent at Brown Harris Stevens and a Palm Beach native. “It could easily fetch $US500 million or more.”\\n\\nThat assumes a buyer views it as a single-family residence. It’s currently not zoned for such use, though Trump is able to reside there through a loophole designating himself an employee. Trump’s legal team engaged an expert witness who argued that a future buyer could do the same thing. And if they didn’t like the idea of sharing their property with others, they could reduce the club to a membership of one. Still, it’s unclear if Palm Beach would allow that without a change to its zoning status. Historically, Mar-a-Lago never made much money for the Trump Organisation, but that seems to be changing. It took in about $US41 million in revenue last year, according to Trump’s most recent ethics disclosure, compared with $US21 million in 2019. Bloomberg values Mar-a-Lago at $US240 million, based on a combination of comparable residential property sales in the area as well as its value as a business, reflecting some uncertainty around its future status. That uncertainty isn’t shared by everyone. If the city and county allowed it, “there is no reason why it wouldn’t be able to converted to a full-time private residence,” said Eli Beracha, director of the Hollo School of Real Estate at Florida International University.\\n\\nTrump’s Fifth Avenue penthouse Trump’s valuation (2021): $US131.3 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US40 million, New York valuation: No current estimate available Trump’s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years, so it’s not surprising that one of the world’s masters of hyperbole exaggerated its size for most of that time. Trump’s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years. Credit: AP Between 2011 and 2016, Trump valued his apartment based on it being 30,000 square feet (2,787 square metres) in size — almost triple its actual measurement of 10,996 square feet. Because of this, New York State arrived at a valuation that was about a third of Trump’s in those years. They haven’t provided a more recent estimate.\\n\\nSpace inflation wasn’t the only issue. Between 2014 and 2015, Trump increased the value of the apartment to $US327 million from $US200 million. The prosecution argues that was to mask a drop in the value of one of his other properties. “A discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,” Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a September ruling. ‘The company has never been stronger and never been better.’ Eric Trump Bloomberg values the property using recent Trump Tower sales, as well as those of comparable Manhattan penthouses. While some splashy residences in much newer buildings on so-called Billionaires Row have listed for well in excess of $US100 million, they typically boast higher ceilings, more up-to-date finishes, contemporary layouts, outdoor space and better views. A better comparison would be a 9450-square-foot penthouse in Olympic Tower, five blocks south on Fifth Avenue, which has been on and off the market for $US35 million since 2016. Then there’s Carl Icahn’s 14,000-square-foot penthouse at Museum Tower on West 53rd Street. It was listed for $US35 million in 2019 before he attempted to split the space and sell it as two separate apartments. Both were eventually delisted.\\n\\nIt’s possible Trump would get a higher price because of his name. “There would be a Trump premium because the person that would want that property is likely to be a Trump supporter,” Beracha said. But it’s also likely that the association with Trump would turn off some buyers. Trump Park Avenue Trump’s valuation (2021): $US90.9 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US86.4 million, New York’s valuation (2021): $US80 million The residential condo tower on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, formerly the Hotel Delmonico, isn’t one of Trump’s best-known buildings, but it’s been the source of some significant asset inflations, according to the prosecution.\\n\\nIts value to Trump mostly stems from unsold condo units that are owned by the Trump Organisation and rented out. A varying number have been rent-stabilised, meaning tenants pay below market rates. Typically, these apartments are valued at a discount because tenants can stay indefinitely, sometimes even passing them on to children. In 2010, 12 rent-stabilised apartments owned by Trump were valued at an average of $US62,500 each in an appraisal provided by a real estate company. The following year, Trump valued them at $US4.1 million each — more than 65 times greater. Trump has continued to value stabilised apartments in the building at market rates, including in his 2021 statement of financial condition. Rent-stabilised units “with a positive cash flow are often valued at 15-25 cents a dollar of the open market value, versus single digits for negative cash flow,” said Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser Miller Samuel. Still, Trump’s optimism was shown to be at least partially justified. By 2021, only five of the 12 apartments remained rent stabilised. The prosecution also claims two additional non-stabilised apartments in the building were overvalued because Trump ignored an option his daughter, Ivanka Trump, had to buy them at a price lower than the market value he used.\\n\\n40 Wall Street Trump’s valuation (2021): $US664 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US270 million, New York’s valuation: No current estimate available In valuing his flagship lower Manhattan office tower, Trump consistently ignored more conservative appraisals he’d received from professionals, New York State argues. Trump has been accused of significantly over-valuing his flagship downtown New York property. Credit: Bloomberg For example, 40 Wall Street was appraised by a real estate company at $US200 million in 2011 and $US220 million in 2012. Despite this, Trump valued the property in financial statements at $US524.7 million and $US527.2 million, respectively, for those years.\\n\\nBloomberg uses a capitalisation of net income approach in coming up with an estimate. Valuations for commercial offices across the board have taken a hit in the past 18 months amid rising interest rates and a lacklustre corporate leasing market. But 40 Wall Street has its own unique problems. Tenant departures meant occupancy slid to 77 per cent in June, down from 98 per cent in 2015. Its net operating income is only 61 per cent of what was projected by underwriters. Loading “There’s not a lot of leasing velocity down there,” said Albert Sultan, a broker at Kassin Sabbagh Realty. The financial district used to offer a lower cost for tenants, but with Midtown rents declining, “there’s no reason to go downtown.” The property is also subject to a ground lease that resets in 2032 at either 6 per cent of the land value or 85 per cent of its rent in the prior year. Based on current rent, that means the ground lease would jump to $US30 million from about $US2.6 million now.', \"A judge ruled Tuesday that Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame and the White House.\\n\\nJudge Arthur Engoron, ruling in a civil lawsuit brought by New York’s attorney general, found that the former president and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing.\\n\\nEngoron ordered that some of Trump’s business licenses be rescinded as punishment and said he would continue to have an independent monitor oversee the Trump Organization’s operations.\\n\\nA Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. Trump has long insisted he did nothing wrong.\\n\\nThe decision, days before the start of a non-jury trial in Attorney General Letitia James’ lawsuit, is the strongest repudiation yet of Trump’s carefully coiffed image as a wealthy and shrewd real estate mogul turned political powerhouse.\\n\\nBeyond mere bragging about his riches, Trump, his company and key executives repeatedly lied about them on his annual financial statements, reaping rewards such as favorable loan terms and lower insurance premiums, Engoron found.\\n\\nThose tactics crossed a line and violated the law, the judge said, rejecting Trump’s contention that a disclaimer on the financial statements absolved him of any wrongdoing.\\n\\n“In defendants’ world: rent regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party’s lies,” Engoron wrote in his 35-page ruling. “That is a fantasy world, not the real world.”\\n\\nManhattan prosecutors had looked into bringing a criminal case over the same conduct but declined to do so, leaving James to sue Trump and seek penalties that could disrupt his and his family’s ability to do business in the state.\\n\\nEngoron’s ruling, in a phase of the case known as summary judgment, resolves the key claim in James’ lawsuit, but six others remain.\\n\\nEngoron is slated to hold a non-jury trial starting Oct. 2 before deciding on those claims and any punishments he may impose. James is seeking $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump doing business in New York, his home state. The trial could last into December, Engoron has said.\\n\\nTrump’s lawyers had asked the judge to throw out the case, which he denied. They contend that James wasn’t legally allowed to file the lawsuit because there isn’t any evidence that the public was harmed by Trump’s actions. They also argued that many of the allegations in the lawsuit were barred by the statute of limitations.\\n\\nEngoron, noting that he had “emphatically rejected” those arguments earlier in the case, equated them to the “time-loop in the film ‘Groundhog Day.'”\\n\\nJames, a Democrat, sued Trump and the Trump Organization a year ago, alleging a pattern of duplicity that she dubbed “the art of the steal,” a twist on the title of Trump’s 1987 business memoir “The Art of the Deal.”\\n\\nThe lawsuit accused Trump and his company of routinely inflating the value of assets like skyscrapers, golf courses and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, padding his bottom line by billions.\\n\\nAmong the allegations were that Trump claimed his Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan — a three-story penthouse replete with gold-plated fixtures — was nearly three times its actual size and valued the property at $327 million. No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.\\n\\nTrump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million — more than 10 times a more reasonable estimate of its worth. Trump’s figure for the private club and residence was based on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use, but deed terms prohibit that, James said.\\n\\nTrump has denied wrongdoing, arguing in sworn testimony for the case that it didn’t matter what he put on his financial statements because they have a disclaimer that says they shouldn’t be trusted. He told James at the April deposition, “You don’t have a case and you should drop this case.”\\n\\n“Do you know the banks were fully paid? Do you know the banks made a lot of money?” Trump testified. “Do you know I don’t believe I ever got even a default notice, and even during COVID, the banks were all paid? And yet you’re suing on behalf of banks, I guess. It’s crazy. The whole case is crazy.”\\n\\nEngoron rejected that argument when the defense previously sought to have the case thrown out.\\n\\nThe judge said the disclaimer on the financial statements “makes abundantly clear that Mr. Trump was fully responsible for the information contained within” them and that “allowing blanket disclaimers to insulate liars from liability would completely undercut” the “important function” that such statements serve “in the real world.”\\n\\nJames’ lawsuit is one of several legal headaches for Trump as he campaigns for a return to the White House in 2024. He has been indicted four times in the last six months — accused in Georgia and Washington, D.C., of plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss, in Florida of hoarding classified documents, and in Manhattan of falsifying business records related to hush money paid on his behalf.\\n\\nThe Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud last year in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. The company was fined $1.6 million. One of the executives, Trump’s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty and served five months in jail. He is a defendant in James’ lawsuit and gave sworn deposition testimony for the case in May.\\n\\nJames’ lawsuit does not carry the potential of prison time, but could complicate his ability to transact real estate deals. It could also stain his legacy as a developer.\\n\\nJames has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years, among other sanctions. The $250 million in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said.\\n\\nJames, who campaigned for office as a Trump critic and watchdog, started scrutinizing his business practices in March 2019 after his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank while trying to obtain financing to buy the NFL’s Buffalo Bills.\\n\\nJames’ office previously sued Trump for misusing his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests. Trump was ordered to pay $2 million to an array of charities as a fine and the charity, the Trump Foundation, was shut down.\", 'Who is Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of crypto exchange FTX? Is he a liar and a fraud? Or did he act in good faith, and like many a startup founder, fly too close to the sun?\\n\\nThat answer ultimately lies with the jury, which was selected on Wednesday morning before lawyers for the government and then Bankman-Fried swapped two very different stories of the former crypto mogul’s sudden rise and almost instantaneous fall.\\n\\nHere’s what happened on the second day of the trial, which featured pointed allegations, a friend from MIT, and an audience replete with big names, including Bankman-Fried’s professorial parents and Damian Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\\n\\nA conscious criminal…\\n\\nThe prosecution’s account of the alleged crimes by Bankman-Fried, who spent most of his day in court staring into a laptop while seated between his two attorneys, featured a study in contrasts.\\n\\n“One year ago, it looked like the defendant was on the top of the world,” began Thane Rehn, a prosecutor for the government, in his opening statement. The former CEO of FTX oversaw a supposedly thriving crypto exchange, jetted between international locales, and hobnobbed with celebrities like Tom Brady and Larry David. He repeatedly emphasized to customers that their money was safe and secure.\\n\\nBut “all of that, all of it, was built on lies,” Rehn declared to the jury. “Behind the curtains, he was not what he appeared to be.” What followed was a roughly 30-minute story that repeatedly emphasized how Bankman-Fried allegedly stole customer funds to facilitate his jet-setting lifestyle, donate millions to political candidates, and finance risky bets.\\n\\nThe key to his alleged scheme? Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund he also owned, argued Rehn. Using Caroline Ellison, his on-again off-again girlfriend and the CEO of Alameda, as a front, Bankman-Fried had “secret access” to customer money—both cash and crypto—the government claimed.\\n\\nMoreover, Bankman-Fried allegedly directed employees to conceal the flow of money into FTX’s coffers and forged financial documents distributed to lenders and investors. “The defendant lied to the world,” Rehn alleged.\\n\\nAnd who was this defendant? Not a crypto “boy” genius, as so many in the media (Fortune included) have written, but a “man” who “stole billions of dollars from thousands of victims,” Rehn said. “You will see the full picture.”\\n\\n…or a well-meaning founder?\\n\\nBut Bankman-Fried, whose cheekbones were more prominent after spending about seven weeks in a Brooklyn prison, was no liar, according to Mark Cohen, one of his lawyers. “Sam didn’t defraud anyone,” he said early on in his opening statement.\\n\\nWhat the jury will see is a nerdy startup founder who acted in “good faith,” not the prosecution’s “cartoon of a villain.” (Cohen repeatedly harped on Bankman-Fried’s allegedly good-faith actions throughout his address to the jury.)\\n\\nAlameda was not subterranean or shady. It was a successful hedge fund, he said. FTX was no Ponzi scheme. It was a “very innovative, successful company.” And the business practices between the two were reasonable, he argued, claiming that Alameda acted legally as an FTX customer, payment processor, and market maker, or financial entity that acts as a trading partner for customers looking to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nIn an analogy he employed throughout his opening statement, he said that “working at a startup is like building a plane as you’re flying it” and that businesses sometimes fail. In fact, he specifically pointed the finger at Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda, who, he said, did not adequately protect her hedge fund from the inherent risk of the crypto markets.\\n\\nWhen the walls came closing in and the aforementioned plane approached the “eye of the storm,” Bankman-Fried did not act like someone who was guilty. Rather, he was willing to give up his personal wealth to make customers whole, Cohen argued.\\n\\n“In the end, Sam started and built two billion-dollar businesses,” he concluded. “He didn’t steal any money.”\\n\\nA Frenchman who lives in London testifies in New York\\n\\nAfter lawyers from both sides depicted two very different Bankman-Frieds, the prosecution called its first two witnesses to the stand—and they weren’t blockbuster names or former lieutenants-turned-government-cooperators, like Ellison.\\n\\nThe first was a victim: Marc-Antoine Julliard, a Paris-born cocoa trader who lives in London. In 2021, Julliard, who had coiffed hair and spoke with a strong French accent, decided to invest in crypto and landed on FTX as his exchange of choice, where he traded cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.\\n\\nOn Nov. 8, in the crypto exchange’s final few days, he tried to pull out his cash and crypto. How much? Almost $100,000, he said. And was he ever able to? “Never,” he told prosecutors.\\n\\nShortly afterward, as the trial neared late afternoon, the government called Adam Yedidia to the stand. A fast-talking graduate of MIT, he and Bankman-Fried were close friends in college, he said. And after Bankman-Fried left Jane Street, the high-frequency trading firm where the former billionaire got his start in finance after MIT, he persuaded Yedidia to join him as a trader at Alameda and then as a developer at FTX.\\n\\nWhen Yedidia first took the stand, Danielle Sassoon, one of the lead prosecutors, said that the college friend of Bankman-Fried had legal immunity during his testimony. Why did he make such a deal with the government, she asked.\\n\\n“I was concerned that I had unwittingly written code that contributed to a crime,” he said.\\n\\nSoon, however, the clock neared 4:30 p.m., and court adjourned for the day. Yedidia will continue his testimony on Thursday, followed by Matt Huang, a former partner at the high-powered venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and then Gary Wang, a key Bankman-Fried lieutenant and one of the government’s star witnesses.']\n",

This past week, I wrote about Rainforest, an Atlanta-based startup that is taking on incumbents such as Fiserv and FIS, as well as trying to take market share from other fintechs such as Stripe with its offering. Rainforest works with software companies to help them embed financial services and payments into their platforms. In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO and co-founder Joshua Silver respectfully disagreed with a16z general partner Angela Strange about her 2019 statement that every company would become a fintech. In his view, most software companies don’t actually want to be fintechs and deal with all the regulatory and compliance issues that go with that. They really just want to be able to accept payments and generate more revenue from being able to do so.\\n\\nAccel led the company’s $8.5 million seed round, which included participation from Infinity Ventures, BoxGroup, The Fintech Fund, Tech Square Ventures, and Ardent Venture Partners.\\n\\nIt’s always cool to see startups outside the coasts growing, and Silver’s confidence that what Rainforest is building will make it a formidable player in the space feels like it has merit. Founded in 2022, the startup has seen impressive growth in a short period of time, securing client commitments representing more than $500 million in processing, with much of the volume guaranteed.\\n\\nSilver believes the company’s exclusive focus on software companies only gives it an edge.\\n\\n“None of the modern processors were built specifically for software platforms. Most of them were built directly for merchants, and they’ve all had to retrofit their platforms even to accommodate basic payment processing and reporting functions for software companies,” he told TechCrunch.\\n\\nAs such, the startup is capturing volume as software platforms migrate from legacy processors such as Fiserv and FIS. As that happens, it competes against companies like Stripe (and its Connect product) to embed financial services and payments.\\n\\nNik Milanović of The Fintech Fund posted on X that he believes that one of the biggest stories of the next decade will be about Stripe, “which looks invincible from the outside, losing market share to nimble competitors.”\\n\\nHe added: “I think Rainforest is going to be a big part of that story.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Infinity Ventures’ Jeremy Jonker and former PayPal exec said he’s been in payments for 13 years and has “never before seen anything like Rainforest.” He told me via email that “Joshua’s background as a software platform founder and then as a payments consultant is a big part of the secret sauce. He’s lived the pain of payments himself, and you can’t underestimate the power of being in your clients’ shoes. He knew that taking on risk and compliance burdens, and offering features like data portability, would be hugely attractive to platforms. We also like that it’s not just him who has a wealth of payments experience — it’s the entire team he’s recruited to the company. Many are longtime payments and SaaS vets who knew there was so much potential for a better provider, and now they’ve built it themselves.”\\n\\nListen to TC+ editor Alex Wilhelm and I talk more about how there’s plenty of market share to go around in Friday’s episode of the Equity podcast below. — Mary Ann\\n\\nPayPal is being sued for alleged “Draconian” payment policies\\n\\nOn October 5, Mary Ann broke the news that PayPal has been hit with a class action lawsuit by consumers represented by law firm Hagens Berman alleging that the fintech giant’s anti-steering rules stifle competition against lower-cost payment platforms such as Stripe and Shopify. Specifically, according to an investigation conducted by the firm’s consumer rights attorneys, PayPal has subjected consumers to excess charges when purchasing from online merchants that accept PayPal or Venmo.\\n\\nSomeone commented on social media that they didn’t see the problem with what PayPal is doing and questioned whether or not Visa and Mastercard do the same thing. So I went back to the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, who noted that the “anti-steering rules” are not the first of their kind. They said: “Visa and MasterCard once imposed similar anti-steering rules on merchants accepting their cards but, after the Justice Department sued the networks for antitrust violations, they agreed in 2010 to eliminate their anti-steering rules as part of the settlement. With payments transitioning into the digital realm, PayPal has simply ripped a page right from the Visa and MasterCard [sic] playbook.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Patrick McGahan, a partner at Scott+Scott who focuses on antitrust litigation, had an interesting take that actually involves both of those card giants. He told TechCrunch that the case illustrates that “the tensions between merchants and the payment system providers are not over, and that litigation regarding this key cost faced by merchants is likely to continue for some time.”\\n\\nHe added: “Platform companies that operate as gatekeepers in their market, such as PayPal, will continue to be the subject of antitrust litigation as a result of the significant fees they charge. PayPal’s fees are, however, driven by the costs imposed upon them by the dominant card schemes, Visa, Mastercard and American Express. So, we can expect PayPal will respond to this suit by arguing that it is as much of a price taker as the merchants themselves, and that the terms imposed upon it by the card schemes drive some of its anti-steering rules.”\\n\\nPayPal did not respond to requests for comment. — Mary Ann\\n\\nBolt CEO gets frank about SEC probe\\n\\nBolt Financial CEO Maju Kuruvilla told me in an interview that the one-click checkout company is putting a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe behind it and is moving on.\\n\\n“It obviously is a very, very involved process, but we’re really happy to put that behind us,” Kuruvilla told TechCrunch. “We look forward to focusing on the momentum for the business and how we can help the retailers, especially the big retailers who are looking to us to innovate for them, because this is a tough year for retailers.”\\n\\nYou might remember that Bolt, which provides checkout technology to merchants, and its co-founder Ryan Breslow, were subpoenaed last year by the SEC to investigate whether the company violated any securities laws during fundraising in 2021 when Bolt was seeking its $355 million Series E round that valued the company at $11 billion.\\n\\nThe investigation took about 15 months, but news of that probe didn’t go public until July of 2023. Shortly thereafter on August 23, the SEC said, in a letter viewed by TechCrunch, it was not recommending an enforcement action for the company.\\n\\nKuruvilla spoke with me about how, exactly, the company can put something like this behind it, what it told customers and what’s next. Read more. — Christine\\n\\nWeekly News\\n\\nBanking-as-a-service startup Synapse confirmed Friday that it laid off 86 people, or about 40% of the company. The San Francisco–based company, which operates a platform enabling banks and fintech companies to easily develop financial services, has been open about past layoffs. In June, CEO Sankaet Pathak wrote in a blog post that the company had let go of 18% of its workforce as “the current macroeconomic conditions” had begun to impact its clients and platforms, affecting its anticipated growth. More here.\\n\\nVisa plans to invest $100 million in companies developing generative AI technologies and applications “that will impact the future of commerce and payments,” Mary Ann reports. Visa Ventures head David Roff told TechCrunch that the fintech giant has “a lot of flexibility” with regards to how many investments it would make out of the new fund, and average check size. More here.\\n\\nAs reported by Manish Singh, “Indian unicorn fintech Slice is merging with North East Small Finance Bank after receiving the approval from the central bank, in an extremely rare feat that has eluded many tech giants, top financial startups and tycoons for decades. Slice — which earlier offered credit card–like cards and at peak issued over 400,000 cards in a month, more than any other fintech or bank — said the merger with the Guwahati-headquartered bank will allow the combined entity to better serve their shared mission and reach more consumers who currently lack access to basic banking services.” More here.\\n\\n“CRED grew its operating revenue by a staggering 255% to $168.1 million in the financial year ending March as the fintech startup, which garners an unusually high level of attention, finds rising adoption of its lending and commerce offerings among India’s affluent individuals. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup had a total income of about $50 million in the financial year ending March last year and $11.4 million in the prior year. More here from Manish Singh.\\n\\nBrex co-CEO and co-founder Henrique Dubugras chose the very picturesque island Fernando de Noronha in northeastern Brazil to be the location of four days of festivities around his marriage to software engineer Laura Fiuza, Brazilian publication Globo reported last week. Some 400 guests are reportedly attending the wedding, which led to the closing of the Forte dos Remédios — one of the island’s main tourist attractions — for more than a week, according to Globo.

It’s powered by Falun Gong, a religious group persecuted in China, which launched The Epoch Times as a free propaganda newsletter more than two decades ago to oppose the Chinese Communist Party.\\n\\nFunded through aggressive online and real-world marketing campaigns and big-money conservative donors, The Epoch Times now boasts to be the country’s fourth-largest newspaper by subscriber count. (Unlike most major newspapers, The Epoch Times isn't audited by the two major independent collectors of circulation data.) The nonprofit has amassed a fortune, growing its revenue by a staggering 685% in two years, to $122 million in 2021, according to the group’s most recent tax records.\\n\\nIts editorial vision — fueled by a right-wing slant and conspiracy theories — is on display in recent reports on how “Jan. 6 Capitol Hill Security Footage Challenges Key Narratives” and “Meteorologists, Scientists Explain Why There Is ‘No Climate Emergency.’” Its video series include a documentary-style film alleging widespread vaccine injury and death and an exposé of an alleged world government agenda to harm farmers, cull the population and force survivors to eat bugs.\\n\\nWhat The Epoch Times lacks in standards, it makes up for in style and form, mirroring the aesthetics of journalism — a feature that’s attracted subscribers and big-name supporters.\\n\\nAnti-vaccine activist and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calls The Epoch Times a daily read, among his most trusted news sources. “They have a real bias against China, but on other reporting, they’re very courageous and it’s real journalism,” Kennedy said in an interview with NBC News this summer.\\n\\nIn July, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., recited the history of The Epoch Times into the congressional record. “This is all about one word: freedom,” Norman said.\\n\\nThe Epoch Times has yet to throw its weight behind a candidate for 2024, but heading into the election cycle, it is moving into new and bigger office spaces and production studios in California, hiring mainstream news veterans who are not affiliated with Falun Gong, and revving up an ad-buying blitz.\\n\\n“They achieved the goal,” said Brendan Steinhauser, a Texas-based Republican strategist hired by The Epoch Times in 2018 to open doors to conservative politicians and players. Steinhauser said that a series of interviews and introductions with politicians and media figures at that year’s Conservative Political Action Conference offered access to a wider conservative audience. The Epoch Times was a “supporting sponsor” for this year’s conference.\\n\\n“They take advantage of every opportunity,” Steinhauser, who is not currently working for The Epoch Times, continued. “They studied digital marketing. They learned how to work the system. And they did it. They're smarter than people give them credit for, and they’ve got the money to back it up.”\\n\\nAs a nonprofit, The Epoch Times is exempt from most federal taxes. Its mission, according to tax filings, is independent journalism, “outside of political interests and the pursuit of profit, for the public benefit and to be truly responsible to society.”\\n\\nNeither the chairman nor the editor-in-chief of The Epoch Times returned multiple requests for comment. Representatives for The Epoch Times have previously defended it against critical reporting, labeling reports of the paper’s conservative mission, and its penchant for misinformation, “smears.”\\n\\nEpoch Times representatives also deny an affiliation with Falun Gong, despite the two groups’ clear financial and organizational ties: The Epoch Times board members and most staff are Falun Gong practitioners. The nonprofits behind The Epoch Times and Friends of Falun Gong, the movement’s advocacy organization, share executives and provide grants and services to each other, according to tax filings. And the newspaper, along with a digital production company and the heavily advertised dance troupe Shen Yun, make up a nonprofit network that the leader of the religious movement calls “our media.”\\n\\nLi Hongzhi during an interview in New York in 1999. Henny Ray Abrams / AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nIn 2009, Li Hongzhi came to speak to his followers, volunteers who worked at The Epoch Times’ offices in Manhattan. Li’s instructions for the group were simple. They needed to reach people outside of the Falun Gong religious community. And they needed to make money. A lot of it.\\n\\n“Ensure that the paper gains a foothold in ordinary society and turns profitable,” Li said.\\n\\nFalun Gong — or Falun Dafa, as some followers call it — is a kind of personal development movement started by Li in China in 1992. It combines tenets of Buddhism and Taoism, and followers practice with meditation and flowing breath and movement exercises, and by studying Li’s teachings.\\n\\nTo his followers, Li is a God-like figure who can levitate, walk through walls and see into the future. His ultra-conservative and controversial teachings include a rejection of modern science, art and medicine, and a denunciation of homosexuality, feminism and general worldliness.\\n\\nIn 1999, after thousands of Li’s followers silently protested its repression in Beijing, China banned it altogether. Labeling it a cult, the Chinese government confiscated Falun Gong books, blocked websites, closed teaching centers and arrested practitioners. Human rights groups reported a brutal crackdown: Some adherents were sent to labor camps; others were tortured and killed.\\n\\nFalun Gong followers meditate outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington in 1999. Joyce Naltchayan / AFP via Getty Images file\\n\\nInternational human rights organizations condemned China’s attempted eradication. In the U.S., where Li and some of his practitioners had fled, a new collection of followers organized a campaign to raise awareness and sympathy with parades, demonstrations and pamphlets that touted the benefits of Falun Gong and the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party.\\n\\nThe Epoch Times was born out of that leafleting campaign. Started in Georgia in 2000 by John Tang, a Falun Gong practitioner who remains its CEO, in essence it was a Chinese-language public relations newsletter. The group’s long-term goals were ambitious: to expose the Chinese Communist Party and to save the world in a supernatural war against communism.\\n\\nThrough the early aughts, The Epoch Times grew from an online effort to a weekly physical newspaper, with a home base in New York and a TV production company, New Tang Dynasty Television. It raised money from followers and was staffed by unpaid volunteers. It ran aggregated articles on international issues from Voice of America next to Thanksgiving Day explainers, dispatches from Falun Gong parades, and exposés on atrocities alleged to have been committed by the Chinese Communist Party.\\n\\nBy 2019, it had gone mostly digital and was spending millions of dollars on creating a network of Facebook pages and groups and running aggressive pro-Trump ad campaigns. The move toward explicit support of Republicans, despite Li’s teachings to stay away from U.S. politics, was foreshadowed by Li’s comments at a Falun Gong conference a year before.\\n\\nLi said that Falun Gong’s media ought to put a “constructive” spin on the news, to advance the group’s aims. It wasn’t wrong, he said, to favorably cover a politician who shared Falun Gong’s conservative values and whose goals aligned with their own.\\n\\n“If someone comes along now who can help to halt the downward spiral that the world is in, then he is truly someone extraordinary!” Li said. “He would in effect be helping us! Wouldn’t he be helping us to save people?”\\n\\nThe Epoch Times also employed a tactic more often associated with fake news content farms and scammers than news organizations, creating a network of inspiring and cute-content pages and fake accounts to inflate The Epoch Times' reach.\\n\\nIn 2019, following reporting by NBC News, Facebook found that The Epoch Times had “leveraged foreign actors posing as Americans to push political content” and banned it from future advertising, citing a violation of policies, including trying to circumvent review systems.\\n\\nUndeterred, The Epoch Times pivoted to video, specifically YouTube, spending millions on internet-infamous ads featuring Roman Balmakov, a former Epoch Times delivery person who now hosts the online show Facts Matter. In the ads, Balmakov rails against the mainstream media, communism and the persecution of Trump.\\n\\nThe Epoch Times also revisited a tried-and-true strategy that the original anti-communism newspaper had been built on — free physical copies. Instead of boxes on street corners, this time The Epoch Times printed and distributed unsolicited special editions of the paper from California to the Carolinas to the U.K. In Philadelphia alone in 2020, the company mailed 280,000 free copies of its newspaper, “to increase subscription,” according to tax documents.\\n\\nThe aggressive online and real-life marketing campaigns paid off. The group reported $76 million in subscription revenue in 2021, compared to nearly $7 million in 2019. A former employee of a regional Epoch Times operation who asked not to be identified because he feared retribution said that in order to send the papers to the most likely customers, they bought lists of addresses from data brokers, specifically for conservatives aged 60 and over. And many of the new subscribers are seniors, according to an employee’s account shared at a Falun Gong conference.\\n\\nBut hundreds of online complaints suggest that not all of the new customers are satisfied.\\n\\n“I’ve had the terrible misfortune of being subscribed to the Epoch Times without my consent,” one reads. Another says: “I want to stop receiving Epoch Times emails. That is all I want.”\\n\\nThe Epoch Times print newspaper in Augusta, Ga., in 2020. Elijah Nouvelage / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\\n\\nAs The Epoch Times’ marketing strategy shifted, so did the content — and by 2020, it became a megaphone for the U.S.’s most extreme right-wing stories.\\n\\nThere was plenty to write about: An election marred by disinformation, the bubbling culture wars and, most helpful for a media company missioned with ending the Chinese Communist Party, a pandemic originating from China provided endless opportunities for takes that aligned with hawkish conservatives and conspiracy theorists.\\n\\nThe Epoch Times was early to lay blame on China for Covid — labeling it the “CCP Virus” in its coverage. (The origin of the outbreak is unknown; the best evidence still points to natural transmission from an animal market.) China’s documented handling of the virus, including withholding information from researchers, a crackdown on whistleblowers and an authoritarian public health response, added credibility to The Epoch Times’ unproven claims.\\n\\n“The dynamic for The Epoch Times changed in 2020, partly because of their criticism of China around Covid,” said A.J. Bauer, an assistant journalism professor at the University of Alabama who studies conservative media. “An entire new kind of ecosystem of Covid deniers and skeptics overlapped with right-wing media and were citing and drawing heavily upon The Epoch Times.”\\n\\nThe Epoch Times’ subscription page began hosting glowing testimonials from Steve Bannon, Glenn Beck and the far-right Arizona congressman Paul Gosar. The organization became a reliable source for misinformation around Covid, its treatments and the vaccines.\\n\\nThe Epoch Times was also an early and aggressive promoter of election misinformation, according to the Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of researchers that documented misinformation and the 2020 vote. The group cited the news organization as a “repeat spreader” of false and misleading voter fraud stories as well as a major promoter of debunked conspiracy theories around Dominion voting machines and the “Stop the Steal” movement, aimed at overturning the election results. Months after the election, The Epoch Times refused to acknowledge the results.\\n\\nWith the new bedfellows came a new revenue stream. Though Falun Gong practitioners had been a reliable source of small donations in previous years, in 2020 the group started to receive gifts and grants from big money conservative donors.\\n\\nWhile The Epoch Times is not required to list its donors, it reported $8.4 million in revenue from contributions and grants in 2020 and 2021. Tax documents from that period filed by scores of donors, accessed through ProPublica’s nonprofit explorer, show some of those funds came from conservative donors and foundations.\\n\\nIn 2021, The Epoch Times received $55,750 from the National Christian Charitable Foundation, which connects anonymous donors with Christian causes, and $31,000 from Donors Trust, a fund for conservative and libertarian donors. Smaller donations came from individuals — real estate agents, investors and surgeons among them — and small family foundations, most of which support right-wing causes, including evangelical Christian groups, anti-vaccine groups and far-right media organizations.\\n\\nMost of the donors contacted by NBC News did not respond to interview requests; two declined.\\n\\nThe Epoch Times is pouring its revenue back into its own organization and others connected to the Falun Gong religious movement.\\n\\nIn the first half of this year, The Epoch Times spent 65% more on ads than in the first six months of 2022, with about half of its budget going to the X platform, formerly Twitter, according to the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Other recent ad buys were made on the right-wing sites Drudge Report, Breitbart and Rumble.\\n\\nThe Epoch Times paid a company called Data Managing Corporation $2.7 million for advertising services in 2021, according to tax documents. The company’s listed address is a single-family home in New Jersey owned by a reporter for The Epoch Times, who did not return requests for comment.\\n\\nIn addition to running its business, The Epoch Times provided about $30 million in grants to its own affiliates and connected organizations in 2021, including $10.4 million to the dance troupe Shen Yun, and $8.3 million to New Tang Dynasty, which produces videos.\\n\\nThe three groups, united under the Falun Gong religious movement, made up a nearly quarter-billion dollar industry in 2021, according to tax documents. Li holds that the Falun Gong messages, shared in articles, videos and dance performances, will result in the salvation of humankind as the end of the world nears.\", 'The financial damage from cybercrimes will reach an astronomical $10.5 trillion by 2025. As global economies go, that would rank third behind only the U.S. and China.\\n\\nBut what’s bad for global conglomerates and the average person could be an opportunity for cybersecurity firms like Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP).\\n\\nEven as rivals like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) cite an uncertain macroeconomic environment for weak billings forecasts, the need for cybersecurity is clearly growing. Global cybercrime damage costs are expected to increase 15% annually over the next two years, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.\\n\\n“There’s never been a better time to be in cyber,” Check Point (CHKP) President Rupal Shah Hollenbeck said in a Zoom interview this week. “It’s fortunate in that organizations are understanding the business value of cybersecurity in a really big way. Unfortunately, it’s because there are more hacks out there than ever before.”\\n\\nFinancials\\n\\nSales at Check Point (CHKP) have grown on a yearly basis amid the increase in demand. For the most recently reported quarter, non-GAAP earnings of $2.07 per share beat the average analyst estimate by 5 cents, while revenue of $596.3M beat by $3.78M.\\n\\nThat resulted in an upgrade late last month at Piper Sandler with signs of recovery on the horizon.\\n\\nThe demand for cybersecurity is strong, but companies are not immune to the realities of the global economy.\\n\\nThis week, rival Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) lowered its billings forecast for the fiscal year, citing the cost of money which has remained a constant discussion with and focus for customers.\\n\\nIt said it is constantly discussing payments in its annual billings plans, which can create variability on total billings more than before depending on financing used or the duration of contracts. Palo Alto (PANW) said it nonetheless sees demand for its products.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) got a slew of analyst downgrades over a disappointing fourth-quarter outlook.\\n\\nThe near- to medium-term is uncertain after disappointing results, Cantor Fitzgerald said. Stifel, which likes the company, said moving parts will take time to play out and shares are expected trade sideways in coming quarters.\\n\\nThe future\\n\\nCheck Point (CHKP) has made three recent acquisitions to expand its offerings.\\n\\nIt has also invested in R&D and launched new products, like the Rugged Industrial Control Systems Gateway, which provides artificial intelligence security and deployments in harsh environments. Other new offerings include Playblocks, which extends the reach of siloed security systems to stop attacks across products, people and processes.\\n\\n“We’ve got to work at it on the go-to-market side, but I feel that all the ingredients are in place and, dare I say it, I think 2024 can be a really fantastic year for us,” Hollenbeck said, adding the company has increased headcount over the past year including a 25% rise in its salesforce.\\n\\nHollenbeck said the company welcomes competition, as they \"bring out the best of innovation for customers.\" The executive spent more than two decades at Intel (INTC) working in Singapore and Beijing, among other places.\\n\\nCheck Point (CHKP) ended the most recent quarter with $3B in cash, which could open the door to additional acquisitions, though Hollenbeck declined to cite specifics.\\n\\nWomen\\n\\nHollenbeck has led the company for almost two years, one of the few C-suite level women in tech. Nearly 17% of tech companies currently have a woman serving as CEO, according to AnitaB.org, which supports women in computing and tech.\\n\\nHollenbeck is a seasoned executive: after Intel (INTC), she spent time at Oracle (ORCL) and is on the board of Neythri Futures Fund, which invests in female founders tapping into a growing base of South Asian female leaders. Although she’s been in tech for nearly 30 years, it hasn’t gotten easier to be a woman in a male-dominated industry.\\n\\nAt most tech events, \"there\\'s never a line [outside] of the lady\\'s room,” Hollenbeck said. “I think it\\'s gotten materially better, but it\\'s only gotten materially better because we started from such a low point.”\\n\\nHollenbeck is proud that four of the top executives at Check Point (CHKP) are women and three women are on the board.\\n\\n“That’s pretty amazing,” she said, pointing to data that shows the more women in leadership roles, the better they perform. According to McKinsey, companies that improved women’s representation outperformed their industry from 2019 to 2022 when compared to other companies with data from the same time period.\\n\\n“When there is gender parity of the board, that company tends to perform higher than the average,” she said. The question is “why is it the best kept secret and why aren’t organizations responding to this faster and better?”\\n\\nWar\\n\\nLike many companies in Israel, Tel Aviv-based Check Point (CHKP) has been impacted by the war, as Hollenbeck said some of its employees have been killed and others have been called to serve.\\n\\nHowever, she stressed operations are normal and business is continuing as usual. Check Point (CHK) has levels of redundancy around the world and research and development happening in several locations, she said.\\n\\nIn addition, the company’s supply chain is 100% outside of Israel and tech support centers and data centers are found around the world.\\n\\n\"We have the right level of redundancies and business continuity plans in place around the world,\" Hollenbeck said. \"So we\\'re okay.\"']\n",

            "            Context: ['Beeper Mini, the app bringing blue bubble iMessage texts to Android users, is back in operation on Monday after a long weekend that saw Apple putting an end to Beeper’s services, claiming it was a security risk. Now, the startup behind the new app says it has resumed functioning, but hasn’t disclosed how that’s been made possible. In addition, Beeper Mini will be free for the time being given the unstable nature of Beeper’s status and Apple’s attempts at shutting it down.\\n\\nFounded by former Pebble smartwatch founder Eric Migicovsky, Beeper had originally been working on an app that aggregated all of a user’s chat apps into a single interface. However, upon the discovery of new technology that allowed it to reverse-engineer the iMessage protocol, it set out to build a new app called Beeper Mini that solely focused on bringing iMessage chats to Android users for $1.99 per month. That included support for high-quality photos and videos, tapback reactions, typing indicators, read receipts and more.\\n\\nThe app quickly climbed into the top 20 in the Play Store’s charts and saw over 100,000 downloads in its first 48 hours, the company claims.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Beeper Mini’s success was short-lived. Only days after launching, Apple on Friday night took action against the startup, having found a way to stop Beeper Mini’s messages from being passed from Android phones to its servers. The Cupertino tech giant explained that it needed to shut down the app because it “posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks.” Essentially, Apple said that it couldn’t verify that Beeper’s claims of end-to-end encryption were true, and therefore it needed to take “steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage.”\\n\\nAs the Beeper team scrambled for a fix, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) shamed Apple for its intervention in a post on X, formerly Twitter, saying “Green bubble texts are less secure. So why would Apple block a new app allowing Android users to chat with iPhone users on iMessage? Big Tech executives are protecting profits by squashing competitors. Chatting between different platforms should be easy and secure,” she wrote.\\n\\nOn Monday, Beeper announced on its blog that it has updated the Beeper Mini app to fix the issue that “caused messages not to be sent or received.” It hasn’t said exactly how it’s made that happen, but notes that the security of Beeper Mini remains unchanged — promising it still includes local, end-to-end encryption as previously described. Migicovsky told TechCrunch he can’t share anything on that topic beyond what’s already in the blog post.\\n\\nThough Beeper Mini is running again, there is a caveat: phone number registration isn’t yet working. That means users will have to sign in with an Apple ID. The startup says it’s working to address this too.\\n\\nIt has also decided to make Beeper Mini free for the time being, given how “chaotic” things have been over the past few days. “As soon as things stabilize (we hope they will), we’ll look at turning on subscriptions again,” the blog post reads.\\n\\nAlthough Beeper did not have its app reviewed by an independent third-party security firm before launch, it’s challenging Apple to put it to the test.\\n\\n“If Apple doubts the security and privacy of our app, we’re willing to share the entire Beeper Mini codebase with a mutually agreed upon 3rd party security research firm,” the blog post stated. Asked if they would run an audit without Apple’s participation, Migicovsky tells us he wants Apple to agree on the firm first. The company also said it would be willing to add a pager emoji to metadata on all its sent messages, which would allow the Messages app to filter out messages from Beeper Mini users.\\n\\nUsers can get the updated version of Beeper Mini from beeper.com/update on their phone for the time being as the company has not yet submitted the new version to the Play Store, claiming it needs to do some final testing. But that means users are being asked to sideload the app update onto their devices, which is riskier than downloading from the Play Store, where apps undergo reviews and basic security checks. The app update is now live on Google Play (updated, 1:28 pm ET).\\n\\nThe update, which now prompts users to sign in with their Apple ID, also includes new features, like chats that will open at the last unread message and an improved video player, the blog post noted. In tests, signing in with our Apple ID generated an Apple prompt that noted our ID was being used to sign in with a device “near Los Angeles, CA” (where we are not located.) We received an error message “2FA submission error” after updating the app, but an uninstall/reinstall fixed this. We understand this is a known bug.\\n\\nAfter setting up the new Beeper Mini, a message appeared on our iPhone that said: “Device Added to Your Account. A Mac now has access to iMessage,” which offers a hint as to Beeper’s fix.\\n\\nApple has not yet gotten in touch directly with Beeper, having only released a statement to the press. It’s unclear at this time if, how, or when it will be able to disable Beeper’s updated build.', 'Twitch has had a tense year, in part due to community backlash over policy changes that affect the way creators can monetize their content.\\n\\nLast year, the company announced that it would end the 70/30 subscription revenue split deal that it had offered select streamers in favor of prioritizing ad revenue. In June, Twitch launched the Partner Plus program, a new monetization tier that would grant eligible creators a 70/30 subscription revenue split on the first $100,000 they make per year. The program further strained its relationship with its community, because the requirements to qualify excluded the vast majority of streamers. Streamers need at least 350 monthly paid subscriptions, and gift subs and monthly subs that come with an Amazon Prime account don’t count.\\n\\nIn response, Twitch pivoted eligibility to a points-based system, assigning a value to each subscription tier. The higher-priced subscriptions now count more toward the point total.\\n\\n📣 We’re updating how we calculate progress toward the Partner Plus program. To recognize deeper support from your community, Tier 1, 2, and 3 subs will earn you 1, 2, and 6 points respectively towards qualifying for the program. pic.twitter.com/HdOiLvg3qC — Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) August 28, 2023\\n\\nTwitch also walked back its policy restricting embedded ads and other sponsored content, following fallout from streamers who depend on branded content as the bulk of their income.\\n\\nThe company’s CEO Dan Clancy, who took over earlier this year, has prioritized engaging with Twitch streamers, and involving their perspectives in policy changes going forward. The company’s receptiveness to community feedback has marginally lessened animosity from its streamers, and community sentiment toward Twitch at this year’s TwitchCon in Las Vegas was significantly more positive than it was last year. New features and policy changes announced during the convention’s keynote address, including granting streamers more control over ad breaks and allowing simulcasting to other livestreaming platforms, also appeased the Twitch community.\\n\\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Twitch’s Chief Monetization Officer Mike Minton discussed the unpopular policy decisions, supporting smaller creators through branded partnerships and what Twitch is doing to mend its relationship with its community.\\n\\nTechCrunch: I’m going to start with a maybe unpleasant question, but Twitch has made some unpopular decisions in terms of monetization. Is there anything that Twitch is doing to appease irate creators?\\n\\nMike Minton: Two years ago, we said we’re no longer gonna do these deals that weren’t objective in terms of eligibility criteria. We ended that program. It affected a relatively small number of creators, but what it really impacted was the community going, “I don’t have anything to work for.” And that led to us recently announcing Partner Plus. There was some feedback saying, “Hey, we’re going to need a lot of subs,” and we reacted to it by making it eligible by sub points so that your higher price point subscriptions cost more, and that was actually received quite positively.\\n\\nBoth Dan and I have said in different forms, that this is the beginning. It’s not the end and we’re going to continue to work to provide access to higher rev shares as we can over time, to more streamers.\\n\\nWhat would that look like?\\n\\nThe simple answer is now, 350 was the criteria we established, right? And that number is arbitrary and could easily come down. Now, our target and our goal in this program still remains the same. We’re looking to benefit the creators, where livestreaming is a meaningful part of what they’re doing as a creator. That allows us to focus on those streamers that are really at a point where it will matter most for them in terms of keeping them as a livestreaming creator.\\n\\nRight, and that decision to change the revenue split also came out of a decision to prioritize ad revenue. Creators and viewers have said that integrating ads in their streams is very frustrating. What kind of feedback is Twitch going to provide in response to that?\\n\\nLet’s level set a couple things. So one of the things we knew with ads, if we’re going to get streamers to buy into ads as a good way to monetize, is that we had to increase the rev share, which we did, and launch the ad incentive program.\\n\\nWe’re helping streamers understand that with ad running, you have to think about it consistently over time in order to earn predictable revenue. It’s a very reliable source of income for many streamers.\\n\\nSo I think the combination of making it easier to run, increasing the rev share and then recently in the keynote, we talked about two new features to allow moderators to know when an ad break is coming, and adjust the ad break around the content because the problem in livestreaming, as you’re aware, is that people don’t want to miss out. So we’re very focused on improving the ad experience by allowing the ad breaks to be synchronized with the content and enrolling moderations and eventually the community in adjusting those ad breaks.\\n\\nLike you said, livestreaming is very different from static content, and tactics for monetization that work for Instagram or TikTok just don’t really work for Twitch or any livestreaming platform. In those cases, what has Twitch done differently from those more standard platforms in terms of making monetization more seamless?\\n\\nOne thing we’ve done since the beginning, where we are a leader, is getting people to take their wallets out and support creators through subscriptions, gifting, cheering. I think that sets us as a unique community-based platform where viewers are directly supporting creators in that way.\\n\\nOther services have tried it but from what I can tell them, what streamers have told me, is that Twitch is really the leader in that way. We’ve spent a lot of time on advertising, because there’s no social media, content distribution service in the world that doesn’t rely on advertising as a component. So ads have been a big focus.\\n\\nAnd the third piece, which is where we’re behind, is sponsorships. We’re now focused a lot on growing sponsorship opportunities for streamers and ensuring that we have three — based on what size you are, where you’re located, how experienced you are, what type of content you’re creating, where you’re located in the world — three options to support you as a creator.\\n\\nI’ve spoken to a lot of creators over the course of my career, and a common gripe seems to be that they can’t subsist off of just subs and ad revenue. They have to have these branded partnerships that are difficult to land for midsize creators and smaller creators. What is Twitch doing specifically to diversify its branded partnership content?\\n\\nWe have this unique opportunity, being part of the third largest and fastest growing advertising business in the world, AKA Amazon. So what we’re actively working on is, as advertisers that come in through Amazon advertising, that they understand the magic of Twitch, that they can easily set up influencer deals programmatically. And ultimately, you don’t have the measurement that they expect.\\n\\nBut because of Amazon’s diversity of advertisers, this is where before it was more focused on endemic advertisers, game publishers, et cetera. And now we’re able to expand that reach to a much broader set of advertisers and serve the needs of both the affiliate marketing end of sponsorships, which is more of a performance model, as well as more of the top of the funnel, where you’re looking for more brand awareness.\\n\\nObviously a lot of this discord among Twitch’s community also comes at a time when other streaming platforms like YouTube or Kick are starting to take off, and enticing streamers with better revenue splits. A common complaint that I’ve heard is that bigger streamers are going to be making money wherever they are, but smaller streamers who have less of an audience don’t qualify for Partner Plus will get a better deal at YouTube or Kick than at Twitch. What is Twitch doing to keep those streamers?\\n\\nThere are a couple of things that I’ll point out. One is acknowledging what Dan has done as the CEO to get out and engage with streamers, hear their concerns, and really influence our priorities as a company, is really a consequence of him both being an active streamer as well as being extremely engaged within the community.\\n\\nAnd then, more broadly for both Jeremy [Jeremy Forrester is VP of Community Product] and myself as the product leaders, building the product is continuing to innovate and ensure that we are absolutely a unique service. Whether that’s features, like we’re working on Stories, whether that’s monetization — it’s all in service of ensuring that livestreaming creators can be more successful on Twitch.\\n\\nFor a long time, there was a sort of exclusivity with Twitch, where there were exclusive deals, and simultaneous streaming on other platforms was forbidden. I have to wonder if those decisions to change these policies were in response to competition from other platforms.\\n\\nI would say it this way: I think they are an acknowledgement, and maybe a closer connectivity to the community via Dan specifically. I credit Dan in his short time as CEO to really make some big, hard decisions. Both the launch of Partner Plus, as well as simulcasting, the embed stuff we talked about in the keynote — these are three things that I think are very much an acknowledgement of the feedback from the community. We’ve made that change, so I wouldn’t call it out of competitive pressures. I would call it out of focus on the community.', 'African mobile video network StarNews Mobile has secured $3 million in pre-Series A funding. StarNews offers African content creators a platform for monetizing their work through a subscription model. Currently, the service is available in six African countries, including Cameroon (where it started), Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Benin and Ivory Coast.\\n\\nFounder and CEO Guy Kamgaing launched the startup in 2017. His inspiration for this venture draws from his extensive 10-year experience in content monetization, particularly within the VAS (Value-Added Services) business. During this period, he actively participated in text/SMS-based campaigns and monetization endeavors, which provided the foundation for StarNews.\\n\\nThe five-year-old mobile video network prioritizes offering monetization avenues for African content creators through distribution partnerships with major telecommunications operators like MTN and Orange. Content creators often face challenges in generating revenue due to limitations on existing streaming platforms. As a result, StarNews connects them to mobile users who often lack access to relevant content due to expensive mobile data plans and a shortage of services tailored to local markets. A win-win for both parties.\\n\\n“I realized that while I could monetize jokes and horoscopes via telcos for several years, no one was monetizing content on the traditional platforms, especially in Africa,” said the \\u200b\\u200bLos Angeles-based Cameroonian entrepreneur to TechCrunch. “There are thousands of creators online that don’t make money on YouTube or other platforms. So it was just putting two and two together, saying, ‘Well, this content is here that no one knows about and is very difficult to get the audience on YouTube and search, but I can help creators make money because I have a relationship with the telcos.’”\\n\\nMobile operators are pivotal in propelling content within Africa’s media industry, with unmatched distribution capabilities. Collaborating closely with these operators is imperative for establishing a solid presence in the market. Over the past few years, these operators have been instrumental in driving data usage across the continent, simultaneously upselling their customers with in-house content or partnering with entities like StarNews. To draw a parallel, Kamgaing stated that you can think of Orange as the “Apple” of Africa’s telecommunications world and MTN as the “Google.”\\n\\nConnecting mobile subscribers to local content creators\\n\\nStarNews boasts an active subscriber base of over 4 million through its partnerships with MTN and Orange across six markets (it exited South Africa after a misalignment with MTN’s strategy for engaging content creators) and a community featuring more than 120 content creators. This approach has enabled StarNews to organically expand its user base while securing nearly $8 million (including a $900,000 friends and family round, a $2 million seed investment and a $1.8 million extension) funding from an array of U.S., European and African VCs, including Investisseurs & Partenaires (I&P), Snap via its Yellow Accelerator program, LoftyInc Capital, Graph Ventures and Expert Dojo.\\n\\nThe platform is structured around channels, with each creator having a dedicated channel. Kamgaing says the company works closely with creators by providing financial support and assisting in content production; additionally, it guides the creators in their digital journey, offering support in digital acquisition. As previously highlighted, a significant portion of the company’s user acquisition comes through telecom operators, as it’s a seamless process for, say, MTN to send messages encouraging its customers to sign up to Star News to watch social media personalities, including music artists, comedians and influencers. For users, the sign-up process is streamlined for convenience, followed by a straightforward payment mechanism, allowing them to pay using their airtime; this works across six different networks, each offering users various bundles, weekly subscriptions and daily plans.\\n\\nIn addition to content produced by creators, StarNews features deeply hyperlocal content, spanning topics such as motorbike taxis in Cameroon or food recipes in Ivory Coast. The platform also hosts genre-specific shows, including the footballing competition African Cup of Nations and a program modeled after a singing reality competition, The Voice. StarNews leverages its partnerships with telecom operators to raise awareness and significantly boost user activations for these shows. For instance, in the 2021 edition of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON), the platform actively produced exclusive content straight from the event, resulting in the acquisition of 600,000 new users. Furthermore, the company sponsors concerts, and at one point, it attracted an impressive 500,000 subscribers by offering them the chance to attend a Fally Ipupa concert.\\n\\nThese initiatives highlight the power of strong partnerships, where telcos take the lead, followed by content creators or show organizers, Kamgaing, an ex-PwC consultant, remarked. According to him, this dynamic results in an influx of eager users to access the content or engage with the telco’s activities while positioning StarNews remarkably well to oversee content distribution, monetization, and creation effectively.\\n\\n“Production without distribution is tough and tougher without monetization. There are a lot of people creating content, but they’ll put it on YouTube and Instagram, platforms that control the distribution. There’s no real monetization. We’re able to have all three layers at the local level. We have offices in all the markets and the teams there are specifically working with creators on content production, which is unique,” said the chief executive, while adding that the platform’s content spectrum has expanded to establish significant partnerships with the likes of Sony and Universal in the region.\\n\\nOpportunity in Africa’s creator economy sector\\n\\nAmong its markets, StarNews has observed the most impressive retention rate in Nigeria, a market that exhibits all the right metrics for exponential growth, according to Kamgaing. Acquiring users is relatively straightforward, and the platform enjoys strong user engagement and stickiness; moreover, monetization is thriving, he said. StarNews employs an internal metric to gauge monetization, known as the billing rate. This metric represents the number of individuals who have sufficient available airtime to pay for digital services; notably, the billing rate is three times higher in Nigeria compared to the Francophone markets.\\n\\nKamgaing revealed that the platform distributed $1 million to content creators last year while maintaining an average monthly payout of around $70,000 to these creators. The fresh injection of capital serves as a significant uplift for Africa’s creator economy, an underserved sector in African tech (despite that startups like e-commerce-focused Selar are holding their own). This funding will equip the Los Angeles-based company, currently with 40 employees, to better support its creators and gradually enhance payouts in the coming years, a crucial step in bolstering the region’s creative industry.\\n\\nAdditionally, in a press statement, Kamgaing outlined the startup’s expansion plans, noting its intent to strengthen its dominant presence in Francophone Africa while quickly expanding across strategic markets like Nigeria and Ghana. StarNews is looking to be in 11 markets by next year, the chief executive remarked on the call.\\n\\nJanngo Capital, an Africa-focused venture capital firm, led the pre-Series A funding round. Other notable investors, such as soccer players Aurélien Tchouaméni of Real Madrid, Jules Koundé of Barcelona and Mike Maignan from AC Milan, all affiliated with athlete representation agency Excellence Sport Nation, participated in the round. Kamgaing, in the interview, highlighted the shared African heritage of these players, underscoring their connection to StarNews’ mission and their genuine interest in engaging with the African audience and investing in startups across the continent. These French soccer players now join the ranks of investors like Blaise Matuidi, a former French international who has previously invested in Sudanese fintech company Bloom and currently heads Origins, a VC firm in collaboration with other soccer players who serve as limited partners.\\n\\nFatoumata Bâ, founder and executive chair of Janngo Capital, affirmed the firm’s support for StarNews, accentuating the platform’s unique positioning, strategic partnerships, technology and content. This support is rooted in the belief that StarNews is well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth potential of Africa’s creative industry, which is poised for a fourfold expansion by 2050 and the possibility to generate up to $20 billion in GDP, she said.\\n\\n“I am very excited and proud to back StarNews, the first media platform that supports African creators and tells the world the real African story,” added Fernand Tchouameni, spokesperson and investment advisor for Aurelien Tchouameni. “Being of Cameroonian descent, I can also see StarNews becoming a bridge to connect with the African diaspora, and I personally look forward to being on it.”']\n",

Third-and-1 at the Bengals\\' 17 with under four minutes to play.\\n\\n11:11 p.m.: Another familiar pattern for the Bills: Sherfield catches a pass for nine yards, then Murray powers ahead for two to pick up the first down at the Bengals\\' 26.\\n\\n11:11 p.m.: The call on the field stands: incomplete pass. Bills face second-and-10, trailing by 14 with 5:33 left and only one timeout left on the board.\\n\\n11:08 p.m.: Allen scrambles right again, and gets 11 yards. His next play is rules incomplete on a pass that just skips in too low for Sherfield.

Latavius Murray gets his first carry and picks up two and the first down to the Bengals\\' 48.\\n\\n11:04 p.m.: Allen goes right back to his trusted tight end, even after the fumble, with Kincaid catching a nine-yard pass to start the drive.

Bengals 24, Bills 10\\n\\n10:59 p.m.: Another toss play outside to Mixon goes for a loss of three, but Burrow finds Smith, who picks up eight yards to the Bills\\' 2 before he steps out of bounds. Third-and-goal at the 2, with the Bengals knocking on the door.\\n\\n10:57 p.m.: Burrow to Higgins has been the top combination all night, and it is again on the third down play.

His star wide receiver finds some open space, and he catches a 32-yard pass up to the Bills\\' 29.\\n\\n10:52 p.m.: Why run it on third-and-1, when Burrow can call a play action then connect with Hudson for 17 yards up to the Cincinnati 39.\\n\\nTanner Hudson had 4 total catches this season entering today.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe has 4 in this game alone 😱\\n\\n\\n\\n📺: #BUFvsCIN on NBC\\n\\n📱: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/T6GLEfxpQv pic.twitter.com/HnhhsUL8In — NFL (@NFL) November 6, 2023\\n\\n10:50 p.m.: Irv Smith drops a pass on first down, but who else but Higgins makes a leaping grab for nine yards over the first down marker.

Bills wind up using their first timeout with 5:54 left in the half and the play clock down to three seconds.\\n\\n10:22 p.m.: Burrow again looks Chase\\'s way, and again comes up empty.

Tyler Bass drills the 34-yard field goal to at least get the Bills a few points. Bengals 21, Bills 10\\n\\n10:12 p.m.: Pressure to Allen has limited him on each of the past two passes.

Bengals head to the locker room leading 21-7.\\n\\n9:49 p.m.: Allen airs the ball out deep down the left side, and after some discussion, officials rule the play as intentional grounding. That\\'s a huge penalty as it backs the Bills out of field-goal range back to the Bengals\\' 48.

But Taylor-Britt is injured on the second pass, and the Bengals have to use a timeout to look him over on the field.\\n\\n9:45 p.m.: Bills start at the 25, and Allen wastes no time getting Buffalo up the field.

That takes this game to the two-minute warning.\\n\\n9:36 p.m.: The Bengals get within a yard, with Burrow firing a short pass over the middle to Boyd, who picks up nine yards to set up a fourth-and-1, and another decision for Cincinnati at the Bills\\' 36.\\n\\n9:32 p.m.: Back-to-back incompletions from Burrow out to Hudson and Chase to start the drive.

Now a third-and-15 from the Bills\\' 37.\\n\\n9:18 p.m.: Bengals try for a quarterback sneak, but he\\'s stopped just short. Cincinnati then takes a delay of game, and Cincinnati is now backed up to a third-and-5.\\n\\n9:16 p.m.: Hudson remains active in the passing game, catching a nine-yard pass from Burrow to start the drive. The Bills use their first timeout with 8:17 left as the Bengals prepare for a second-and-1 from the Bills\\' 23.\\n\\n9:15 p.m.: Allen makes his first mistake of the game.

That will bring this quarter to an end.\\n\\n8:55 p.m.: Bills will take the ball at the 25 on the fair catch at the 2.

Each Monday, Mike Sando breaks down the six most impactful takeaways from the week.\\n\\nThe San Francisco 49ers entered Week 6 riding a 15-game winning streak and looking unstoppable with a young quarterback, Brock Purdy, who was making the game look easy. They exited with a 19-17 defeat at Cleveland, injuries to key players and, for the first time this season, a question mark or two.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWith the previously unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles also losing ugly Sunday, this edition of the Pick Six column addresses key questions facing Super Bowl favorites with one-third of the 18-week regular season nearly complete.\\n\\nSo far this season, we’ve seen the Miami Dolphins set NFL records for offense, only to lose by four touchdowns in their lone game against a true contender. We’ve seen the Kansas City Chiefs win with defense, sometimes in spite of their offense. We’ve seen the Buffalo Bills incur devastating injuries. Here we’ll address 10 teams with the shortest Super Bowl odds, running through what I think and what NFL insiders have to say.\\n\\nThe full Pick Six menu this week:\\n\\n• Unanswered questions for contenders\\n\\n• When “playing to win” goes too far\\n\\n• Championship roster, rookie kicker\\n\\n• Do they make wristbands for coaches?\\n\\n• Giants, Vikings and winning too soon\\n\\n• Two-minute drill: Wackiest win in a while\\n\\nGO DEEPER The Eagles' 'tush push' play is taking over the NFL. But is it working?\\n\\n1. Where do the top 10 current Super Bowl contenders stand one-third of the way through the season? Let’s hit key questions facing the Chiefs, Eagles, 49ers, Bills, Bengals, Cowboys, Ravens, Lions, Dolphins and Jaguars.\\n\\nYou can scroll through the latest Super Bowl future odds from BetMGM below.\\n\\n• San Francisco 49ers: What do they have in Purdy?\\n\\nWhat I think: Let’s start with what the 49ers do not have in Purdy. They do not have an AFC North-certified, weatherproof Ben Roethlisberger clone able to overpower the elements, break away from defensive linemen and thrive in the conditions Purdy faced against Cleveland. What they do have is a good, young quarterback well-suited to run Kyle Shanahan’s offense at a high level by making quick decisions when given time to find open receivers.\\n\\nExec comment: “The 49ers knew they needed a good quarterback to win the Super Bowl, and they knew they could help Purdy be that. Give him a great receiving tight end, two good receivers and a great halfback who fits the system, and they’ll get someone open on every pass play. But then Deebo Samuel gets hurt, Christian McCaffrey gets hurt, and now we don’t have as many guys open. Especially when you face a defensive coordinator who says, ‘You show me you can beat me throwing the ball outside the numbers — best of luck, and to do that, you are going to have to take a five-step drop and I’m going to have Myles Garrett chasing you every play.'”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• Kansas City Chiefs: Is the explosive passing game gone for good?\\n\\nWhat I think: The Chiefs have never scored less per game on offense through six games or a full season since Patrick Mahomes became their quarterback. They have also never enjoyed larger average point differentials (9.8 per game), because their defense is so much better. I think the pass offense will become slightly more explosive as Mahomes gets reps with his receivers, but I’m not expecting a huge shift.\\n\\nThe Chiefs are averaging 9.5 plays per touchdown drive when starting at least 70 yards from the opponent’s goal line, per TruMedia. That figure was 7.8 in Mahomes’ first year as the starter and has climbed every season since. It’s a testament to the Chiefs’ adaptability, but also a reflection of plummeting explosive play rates.\\n\\nExec comment: “Yeah, it looks harder for them on offense until Mahomes finds (Travis) Kelce on every major third down, every major two-minute play, every major touchdown. Kansas City has the luxury of their best players being their toughest players. Chris Jones is a very tough player. Kelce is a very tough player. Mahomes is a very tough player. You wonder why they win the games? Because the games are won by the toughest teams most of the time.”\\n\\n• Philadelphia Eagles: Has Jalen Hurts regressed? Where are the explosive pass plays?\\n\\nWhat I think: Explosive passing is down through most of the league, including for the Eagles. They are gaining more than 15 yards on just 11 percent of pass plays, down from 21 percent through six games last season and 19 percent for 2022 overall. Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert are still on the team, so I’m inclined to trust the production will return. But there’s also a lingering fear defenses have caught up to aspects of the Eagles’ scheme. Does Philly have a counterpunch?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nExec comment: “People are going to crush Hurts and the offense. They are just churning the clock so much. It just feels like they are imposing their will on teams through the run game and through their short passing and it just hasn’t taken off from an explosive passing standpoint, so when they play a team that can move the ball on them through the air, it presents some challenges.”\\n\\nGO DEEPER Behind the AI magic that lets Amazon's Prime Vision show the NFL like never before\\n\\n• Buffalo Bills: Are the defensive injuries too much to overcome?\\n\\nWhat I think: The rest of the conference is the key variable. The Bills are diminished. They have imperfections. But Buffalo already defeated the Dolphins. The other AFC teams aren’t exactly peaking. Kansas City and Cincinnati appear easier to defend this season than in the recent past. We’ll see how well the Dolphins hold up. This can still be Buffalo’s season.\\n\\nExec comment: “Matt Milano and Tre’Davious White, those are huge injuries for that football team. The Bills are not as dominant as they felt going into it with so many injuries on defense. But the division they are in, they will still be able to slug it out and get to where they need to go. Nobody has really emerged in the AFC to unseat these teams at the top.”\\n\\n• Miami Dolphins: Has Tua Tagovailoa proven he’s built to last?\\n\\nWhat I think: It was tough watching Tagovailoa last season without worrying for his physical well-being. I’ve never felt that way watching him so far this season, and will feel even better if he plays a full game against Philadelphia in Week 7. New England, Kansas City, the Jets (twice), Washington, Tennessee, Dallas, Baltimore and Buffalo will all get their shots at Tagovailoa. I’m cautiously optimistic, but think there will be games when defense muddy the picture sufficiently to create turnovers.\\n\\nExec comment: “Interesting team. They put up 70 on Denver and should have put up 70 on the Giants. No one can keep up with that kind of firepower. But they also haven’t really beaten anyone. They were down 14 points to Carolina. Do you think they are coming back from 13 down against Philly? In my opinion, no.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• Dallas Cowboys: Is this team any better than previous Dallas teams that fell short?\\n\\nWhat I think: It’s a tough time to evaluate the Cowboys fairly because they were so bad against San Francisco on a big stage in their most recent game. I just don’t see where Dallas is better or going to get considerably better, especially on offense. And every time they enjoy success, they seem to enjoy it a little too much. That is a reflection of their owner.\\n\\nExec comment: “Run defense and consistency on defense, and then offensively, what is their identity? They just are not very good. Their best games are when they play great defense and get turnovers, but that is not going to happen enough, especially against the good teams.”\\n\\n• Detroit Lions: Have they fixed their defense?\\n\\nWhat I think: The Lions are 11.3 EPA per game better on defense from last season to this season, the second-largest gain for any team since last season. The schedule has something to do with that, but the 2022 defense was so bad, it couldn’t stop Carolina. Detroit will win the NFC North and return to the playoffs, which will make this season successful no matter what happens from there. But we won’t find out until the postseason just how much better the defense might be, because the remaining schedule features so many weak offenses. That includes Chicago twice, Green Bay, Denver and Las Vegas.\\n\\nExec comment: “Yes, I do buy them. This is a league full of teams who do not really know who they are week to week. Detroit knows who they are, and they play to their identity. Anytime you know who you are and play to that style, you have a chance to be dangerous.”\\n\\n• Baltimore Ravens: Are the Ravens better off shifting to more of a pass-oriented offense?\\n\\nWhat I think: Baltimore has never scored fewer points or amassed less offensive EPA through the first six games of a season with Lamar Jackson in the lineup. The schedule and injuries have played roles, but with the Ravens shifting toward a more conventional pass offense, are the explosive quarterback runs mostly in the past? Jackson has one rush longer than 20 yards (he’s had four or five by now previously). He’s gaining at least eight yards on 15 percent of carries, half his previous rate. I’m not expecting a consistent precision passing game to suddenly materialize. Will this new offense be tougher to defend?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nExec comment: “The defense keeps them in it, but I don’t necessarily think this offensive change is going to make them any better when it counts. Lamar Jackson does not appear as dynamic as a runner, but in this offense, he does not need to be. He is regulated to pass from the pocket, but you are taking away the biggest weapon the offense had when you do that. Odell (Beckham) is not that guy anymore. Who are you truly afraid of on that offense? Nobody but Lamar, and if you are not using Lamar in a certain capacity, he becomes just like the rest of these quarterbacks around the league — hit or miss.”\\n\\n• Jacksonville Jaguars: Are they ready for prime time?\\n\\nWhat I think: Trevor Lawrence’s knee injury was the big concern coming out of Sunday. If he’s out, expectations shift dramatically. More than the other AFC contenders, the Jaguars seem early in their life cycle, still finding their way. That makes them a little harder to trust in big spots but also leaves greater space for growth. Let’s hope those test results on Lawrence’s knee come back clear.\\n\\nExec comment: “I like Jacksonville. Doug (Pederson) has a championship pedigree. This team is relatively young. They are scrappy. The fact that they have been there before gives them a chance. I think the quarterback is growing.”\\n\\n• Cincinnati Bengals: Can Joe Burrow hold up for a full season?\\n\\nWhat I think: Burrow is looking healthier over the past two weeks. The bye week comes at a great time for Burrow to get even healthier, but check out the schedule on the other side: San Francisco, Buffalo, Houston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Jacksonville. Cincy still has a second game with the Steelers, plus games against Kansas City and Cleveland. I’m worried Burrow will wear down against these defenses.\\n\\nExec comment: “You cannot always expect Joe Burrow to create magic with a bottom-half offensive line. The line is my concern all the way.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n2. Are teams sometimes going too far playing to win? The Eagles come to mind after falling 20-14 to the Jets.\\n\\nMost would agree teams have gotten smarter in their handling of fourth-down situations, going for it when it makes sense, instead of punting almost out of habit. Making the aggressive play to win can absolutely be the smart play, regardless of results. It’s progress when teams seriously wrestle with these questions, not just on fourth down, but in all aspects of their strategy.\\n\\nBut when the Eagles tossed a killer interception on third-and-9 from their own 46-yard line while protecting a 14-12 lead against the Jets with two minutes left in the fourth quarter, a longtime NFL exec reached out with a question: “Have we come too far with coaches wanting to ‘win’ the game instead of sometimes being more traditional?”\\n\\nHis point: Philadelphia could have run the ball on third-and-9, then punted from around midfield. The Jets would have taken possession with barely more than a minute remaining, no timeouts and Zach Wilson behind center facing a ferocious Eagles pass rush. Was having Hurts pass in a situation when gaining a first down is unlikely the smart play under the circumstances?\\n\\n“Are coaches not willing to go against the slight statistical benefit that WPA (win probability added) provides?” the exec asked. “Is it no longer OK to let your defense win the game when it clearly has a huge talent/performance advantage? This Eagles game was 14-12, not 37-35.”\\n\\nCritics attuned to the trend toward aggressiveness pounce when teams pass up chances to go for the kill. Coaches know team owners tend to be fans, not football strategists. They know owners listen to these criticisms. That can provide an incentive to make the aggressive play, to go down swinging.\\n\\n“Everybody thinks they are playing Brady, Manning or Rodgers in two-minute,” a veteran coach said. “If before the game someone offered Philly to put its defense against Zach Wilson on a need-field-goal drive starting inside his own 15 with no timeouts and a minute left, you think they would have taken it?”\\n\\nIn the situation Sunday, the Jets’ offense had netted 19 yards on its previous three possessions, producing one field goal on a drive that gained 16 of those yards. The Eagles had already suffered three turnovers. They knew Wilson would be taking over deep in his territory with very little time remaining.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“To me, these are exactly the type of factors that a coach needs to consider when deciding,” the exec said. “I think they were ignored here.”\\n\\nThe situation Philly faced against the Jets was the seventh time since 2000 that a team leading by 1-2 points in the final two minutes faced third down with 7-10 yards to go from the minus-40 yard line to midfield, with the opponent holding no timeouts.\\n\\nThree of the seven teams passed, resulting in one first down, one sack and Hurts’ interception. Of these three teams, only the Eagles lost the game.\\n\\n3. The 49ers lost Sunday when their rookie kicker missed from 41 yards. Is San Francisco wise trusting a championship roster to a rookie’s foot come playoff time?\\n\\nThe 49ers raised eyebrows among some when they used their second-highest pick in the 2023 draft — a third-round choice, 99th overall — for a kicker. The selection of Michigan’s Jake Moody gave the 49ers a cost-effective successor to veteran Robbie Gould. General manager John Lynch called Moody a potentially “foundational” player whose stock in the draft was so high, other teams were trying to trade ahead of San Francisco for a shot at him.\\n\\nWho do you want lining up the potential winning kick in a Super Bowl? It’s an interesting question in a season that has seen Moody and Saints rookie Blake Grupe miss game-winning tries, but the data could be on the 49ers’ side.\\n\\nFGA Dist Rookies Veterans <33 Yds 97% [31-32] 94% [330-351] 34-44 Yds 75% [21-28] 82% [230-279] 45-50 Yds 78% [7-9] 73% [121-165] 51-55 Yds 100% [8-8] 59% [33-56] 56+ Yds 0% [0-1] 55% [6-11] Totals 86% [67-78] 84% [720-862]\\n\\nThe table above shows field-goal make rates in the postseason since 2000 for rookie kickers vs. veterans. The numbers stack up pretty evenly across various distance cutoffs. Based on these numbers, there’s no statistical indication rookies are less effective in the postseason.\\n\\n“Playoff teams have a different aura, different feel in the locker room,” a veteran evaluator said. “Percentages are one thing, but who is the guy who trots out there to try the game-winner? It’s a different pressure shooting free throws up by 20, down by 20, than in that type of situation.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFans might recall rookie kickers missing playoff kicks: Rodrigo Blankenship with the Colts in 2020, Harrison Butker with the Chiefs in 2017, Nate Kaeding with the Chargers in 2005. But the NFL has seen plenty of rookies kick effectively in the postseason as well. Evan McPherson made all 14 postseason tries with the 2021 Super Bowl Bengals. The 2017 Eagles won a Super Bowl with rookie Jake Elliott performing well. The 2012 Super Bowl champion Ravens had rookie Justin Tucker, while the 2006 Patriots trusted rookie Stephen Gostkowski.\\n\\n4. Do they make wristbands for head coaches? That is not the only question facing the Broncos.\\n\\nDenver Broncos coach Sean Payton has made clear his frustration with quarterback Russell Wilson in myriad ways, including when he suggested Wilson could at some point wear a wristband if it would help speed up communication in the huddle.\\n\\nWe joked on the Football GM Podcast that the head coach himself could have used a wristband to assist with game management after the Broncos called timeout before punting with 22 seconds left in the first half of a 19-8 defeat at Kansas City in Week 6. Payton said he thought Denver was heading into third down, not fourth, when he called timeout, helping the Chiefs’ drive to a field goal.\\n\\nIt wasn’t an isolated miscue. Denver has twice this season used all three timeouts with at least four minutes remaining before halftime. Payton suffered that fate only four times in 258 total games coaching the Saints, when his association with Drew Brees was one of the most successful partnerships in recent NFL history. Payton has had it happen twice in six games with Wilson as his quarterback.\\n\\nRussell Wilson’s hold on the starting job in Denver seems more tenuous with every game. (William Purnell / USA Today)\\n\\nAcross the league, teams have used all their first-half timeouts above four minutes just 14 times since 2020. That includes six times by Carolina when Matt Rhule coached the Panthers. Payton is the only other coach with more than one such game over the past three-plus seasons.\\n\\nThe irony is rich in Denver, where Payton’s predecessor, Nathaniel Hackett, was mocked for his game management so thoroughly, the team made him hire veteran assistant Jerry Rosburg to help him after only three games (Denver was 2-1 at that point). The Broncos under Hackett had trouble getting out of the huddle on time.\\n\\nHackett took the hit for those issues, but when the problem recurred under Payton, the blame shifted to Wilson, the common denominator.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAll of this is pointing toward a future in Denver that includes Payton but not Wilson. Payton’s game plans over the past two weeks were conservative enough to suggest the coach was publicly demonstrating he does not think he can run his offense as currently configured, despite some success on the ground. These game plans were conservative enough to signal a potential in-season quarterback change. Denver faces Green Bay and Kansas City over the next two weeks before heading into its Week 9 bye.\\n\\n5. You play to win the game, but can you win too quickly? The Giants and Vikings are test cases.\\n\\nThe New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings exceeded expectations under first-year head coaches in 2022. Both reached the playoffs. Both are struggling in their second seasons, facing difficult questions about the future. Would they have been better off enjoying only moderate success early? That could depend on how well the football leadership has communicated with ownership.\\n\\nEvery head coach and general manager wants to win as much as possible, but the goal is to build for the long term, which can require time to do things with sustainability in mind. Bad teams that win right away can reset expectations for fans and ownership, making it less practical to take one step backward in the short term for a better shot at taking two steps forward down the line.\\n\\nWhat do the Giants’ and Vikings’ ownerships think?\\n\\n“The best first year can be that 7-10 season where you show some promise,” a veteran coach with experience on a half-dozen teams said. “The Giants won a bunch of games early, people were heaping praise on the head coach, people get the expectation of what the quarterback can be. But oftentimes, you know different internally because you know the house you are living in. You are inside the walls every single day and you know where the roof leaks, where the foundation is cracked.”\\n\\nBuffalo managed such a situation well. The Bills surprisingly reached the playoffs in their first season under Sean McDermott, a euphoric moment after a 17-year playoff drought. They went 6-10 the next year, then began a steady rise behind Josh Allen and a top defense. There isn’t a Josh Allen on the Giants or Vikings.\\n\\nMinnesota in particular finds itself in an interesting spot, with Kirk Cousins approaching free agency and playing well enough, most likely, to keep the Vikings from climbing too high in the draft order.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“They already gave a contract to (tight end) T.J. Hockenson, and they are going to give one to (receiver) Justin Jefferson,” an exec said. “Now, what? Are you going into the rookie pool and taking the fourth-best quarterback in the draft? You can look like Atlanta with (Desmond) Ridder pretty quick.”\\n\\n6. Two-minute drill: There were already many ways to win a game before the Dolphins invented another one.\\n\\nThe Dolphins were one of 223 teams since 2000 to be favored by at least 13.5 points in a regular-season or playoff game. Seventeen of those 223 teams fell behind by 14 or more. Six of the 17 won anyway. The Dolphins were the only one of those 223 teams to win and cover the spread, which was 13.5 for this game.\\n\\n• Six catches for 163 yards and a touchdown against Carolina left the Dolphins’ Tyreek Hill with 812 yards through the first six games. That ranks second in NFL history to Hall of Famer Don Hutson, who had 819 yards through six with Green Bay in 1942.\\n\\nReceiving Yards Through Six NFL Games Rk Player Season Yds 1 Don Hutson 1942 819 2 Tyreek Hill 2023 812 3 Wes Welker 2011 785 4 Elroy Hirsch 1951 766 5 Santana Moss 2005 743 6 DeAndre Hopkins 2015 726 7 Raymond Berry 1960 725 8 Jerry Rice 1986 723 9 Bob Boyd 1954 718 10 Bobby Mitchell 1962 714\\n\\n• Jared Goff is enjoying the second-best start to a season for his career from a statistical standpoint, behind only his 2018 Super Bowl season with the Rams. With the Lions at 5-1 and Goff heading toward a likely contract extension, could another team come after his injured backup, former University of Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker?\\n\\nRandy Mueller raised the thought last week, recalling examples from his career as a GM when offering a pick one round higher than a prospect’s actual draft round proved alluring. Detroit used a third-round choice for Hooker, who is recovering from ACL surgery. Hooker would have been valued higher if healthy. Could that be true again at some point in the future?\\n\\n• News that Indianapolis Colts rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson might undergo season-ending shoulder surgery could carry a silver lining. Richardson got to play enough for the Colts to evaluate where he stands, but if he shuts it down for the season, neither he nor the team would have to suffer through a full season of growing pains. Gardner Minshew’s three-pick game against Jacksonville on Sunday works against the idea Indy is better positioned to compete with the journeyman in the lineup, but most coaches and execs I’ve spoken with believe that to be the case in the short term.\\n\\n(Top photo: Dustin Satloff / Getty Images)\\n\\nThe Football 100, the definitive ranking of the NFL’s best 100 players of all time, goes on sale this fall. Pre-order it here.\", 'Week 10 in the NFL had some of the league\\'s best teams not playing. But that didn\\'t stop the excitement, with five teams winning on walk-off field goals and more games coming right down to the wire.\\n\\nWith that, there were some surprising results and expected domination. Some favorites dug deep to win. Some underdogs turned in shocking upsets.\\n\\nPutting the latest wins and losses into a blender, here\\'s Sporting News\\' updated look at how all teams stack up against each other, 1-32 going into Week 11:\\n\\nNFL WEEK 11 PICKS: Straight up | Against the spread\\n\\nNFL power rankings Week 11\\n\\n1. Philadelphia Eagles 8-1 (previous week: 1)\\n\\nThe Eagles enjoyed a bye trying to get a little healthier for the more difficult stretch run in a top-heavy NFC as they have tough games at the Chiefs (the Super Bowl 57 rematch), vs. the Bills, vs. 49ers and at the Cowboys in the next four. They still look like the conference team to beat as they have proved they still win in many ways around Jalen Hurts.\\n\\n2. Kansas City Chiefs 7-2 (3)\\n\\nThe Chiefs had a pretty good week off given they jumped back into the AFC\\'s top seed and home-field advantage spot with the Ravens losing. They already are rolling defensively and expect them to figure out a lot more around Patrick Mahomes after the key Andy Reid bye.\\n\\n3. Detroit Lions 7-2 (5)\\n\\nThe Lions are becoming like the Eagles, and that\\'s what makes them the second-best team in the NFC. They can win shootouts with Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown and their passing game. They also can dominate with the running game. They can win with offense or defense. Dan Campbell is coach of the year.\\n\\n4. San Francisco 49ers 6-3 (8)\\n\\nThe 49ers had a surprise offensive get-well game in Jacksonville with Brock Purdy leading the way and all his key supporting weapons doing damage, even without Christian McCaffrey scoring. The biggest development was the defense going back to dominating a good offense.\\n\\n5. Baltimore Ravens 7-3 (2)\\n\\nThe Ravens\\' offense is just fine with the running and passing of Lamar Jackson, but he still can\\'t afford to make big mistakes, which he did vs. the Browns. The defense needs to pick up the pieces, too, stat, ahead of facing the Bengals on a short week.\\n\\n6. Miami Dolphins 6-3 (6)\\n\\nThe Dolphins got a much-needed bye to figure out how to beat the better teams in the league. Their defense should be getting a little better to support their often explosive offense. They should feel good about a Week 11 rebound vs. the Raiders.\\n\\n7. Pittsburgh Steelers 6-3 (9)\\n\\nThe Steelers are playing the way Mike Tomlin wants, with the running game rolling to big totals with Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris and the defense doing what it needs, more so vs. pass than run, in key moments. You can\\'t argue with the overachieving results.\\n\\n8. Cleveland Browns 6-3 (10)\\n\\nThe Browns proved they can win games with defense in another way, with big plays. They also have more offensive pop when Deshaun Watson plays well and the running game doesn\\'t slump. Their playoff hopes look much better after their stunning comeback vs. the Ravens.\\n\\n9. Jacksonville Jaguars 6-3 (4)\\n\\nThe Jaguars got an NFC wake-up call against the 49ers, who were much more prepared after a Week 9 bye than they were. Jacksonville needs to forget that debacle and get back on track, stat. The team gets a division double vs. Tennessee and Houston before facing Cincinnati.\\n\\n10. Dallas Cowboys 6-3 (11)\\n\\nThe Cowboys took advantage of their \"no contest\" vs. the Giants at home with Dak Prescott continuing to ball as a passer and runner. They need to keep the defense and running game success, too, in bigger games going forward.\\n\\nMORE: Inside the Cowboys historic offensive explosion vs. Giants\\n\\n11. Seattle Seahawks 6-3 (13)\\n\\nThe Seahawks needed every ounce of their offense around Geno Smith to rally to beat the Commanders, but the get-well performance worked well for him, Kenneth Walker and the wide receivers. The defense could be more consistent.\\n\\n12. Minnesota Vikings 6-4 (14)\\n\\nThe new man on the Vikings, Josh Dobbs, keeps producing the same results they were enjoying offensively with Kirk Cousins, thanks to more help from the running game for Kevin O\\'Connell and the defense overall under Brian Flores. Their 0-3 and 1-4 starts are distant memories as the Vikings look for a sixth straight win in Week 11 vs. Denver.\\n\\n13. Houston Texans 5-4 (16)\\n\\nThe Texans are looking great with C.J. Stroud leading their offense and now they\\'ve found some running game, too. The defense is just making enough plays to put them in position to win high-scoring games. Houston is a legitimate playoff contender under rookie coach DeMeco Ryans.\\n\\n14. Cincinnati Bengals 5-4 (7)\\n\\nThe Bengals are battling some key injuries, leaving them much less room for error. Unfortunately, Joe Burrow made key mistakes and the defense wilted against run and pass at home in the loss to the Texans.\\n\\n15. Buffalo Bills 5-5 (12)\\n\\nThe Bills fell right into the trap game against the Broncos at home, losing because of more mistakes from Josh Allen. The defense can\\'t tolerate those mistakes with all of its injuries.\\n\\n16. Las Vegas Raiders 5-5 (22)\\n\\nThe Raiders are hot, having won two consecutive games for interim coach Antonio Pierce, bringing up flashbacks to the playoff push they made with Rich Bisaccia in 2021. They are right back in the AFC wild-card race with the Dolphins, Chiefs, Vikings ahead.\\n\\n17. New Orleans Saints 5-5 (15)\\n\\nThe Saints will go into a bye not knowing what do at quarterback. with Derek Carr further hurting his right shoulder and needed to be checked for a concussion. Jameis Winston did provide a spark, too little too late at Minnesota. But the division lead is precarious with poor QB play overall.\\n\\n19. Indianapolis Colts 5-5 (19)\\n\\nThe Colts stopped scoring at least 20 points in every game during their ugly, run-heavy victory in Germany vs. the Patriots. At least Jonathan Taylor is doing his normal things and the defense is playing well again while Gardner Minshew looks meh.\\n\\n18. Los Angeles Chargers 4-5 (17)\\n\\nThe Chargers got well offensively with Justin Herbert, Keenan Allen and Austin Ekeler against the Lions. But the defense went back to crumbling vs. big pass plays and added wilting against the run. The pressure is right back on Brandon Staley with a trip to Green Bay next.\\n\\n20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 4-5 (23)\\n\\nBaker Mayfield and the offense is back on track to move the ball well after a brief midseason slump. They\\'re still not lighting it up, but the Bucs are back to playing smart complementary football with their defense rebounding and still might have found a long-term QB answer.\\n\\n21. New York Jets 4-5 (18)\\n\\nAaron Rodgers can\\'t come back soon enough, and going for a December miracle might be too late after two straight key losses to the Chargers and Raiders. Zach Wilson will always cap the potential of a talented offense that keeps making mistakes. The Bills and Dolphins in back-to-back division games next might be their season.\\n\\n22. Denver Broncos 4-5 (24)\\n\\nThe Broncos got another big win against a AFC power, sandwiching their Week 9 bye with upsets over the Chiefs and Bills. The offense has hit a balanced grooved with Russell Wilson and the defense is making a lot more plays, too.\\n\\n23. Washington Commanders 4-5 (21)\\n\\nThe Commanders should be pleased about Sam Howell and the offense showing more fight with additional weapons and the running backs look better all-around again. But the reeling defense and pass protection continue to be un-winnable assets.\\n\\n24. Atlanta Falcons 4-5 (20)\\n\\nThe Falcons were forced into another QB change because of injury. They found a few more answers offensively but that position still made it an overall mess. The defense also doesn\\'t seem to be well prepared to different styles of offenses.\\n\\n25. Green Bay Packers 3-6 (25)\\n\\nThe Packers saw some improved work from Jordan Love and his young weapons as they spread the ball well in the passing game, but the run defense woes and key holes in coverage have all but doomed their playoff hopes.\\n\\n26. Los Angeles Rams 3-6 (26)\\n\\nThe Rams are hoping to find a few more answers during a bye, as Sean McVay has seen his good coaching job earlier in the season go by the wayside with key offensive injuries. They need Matthew Stafford to help save face the rest of the way or the season will look a lot like 2022.\\n\\n27. Tennessee Titans 3-6 (27)\\n\\nWill Levis is going through rookie lumps after his dazzling debut as the brutal offensive line woes exacerbated by injuries are getting to him and the entire Titans offense. The Titans still need to keep starting him, because they can\\'t overcome those systemic problems or those in overall pass defense.\\n\\n28. Chicago Bears 3-7 (29)\\n\\nThe Bears don\\'t care how they win, but they should be pleased their running game and defense bailed out their limited passing game with Tyson Bagent to secure another win in Week 10. They will hope to finish strong with Justin Fields soon.\\n\\n29. Arizona Cardinals 2-8 (32)\\n\\nThe Cardinals got an immediate spark for their offense with Kyler Murray and James Conner back. They also seemed invigorated for Jonathan Gannon on defense and special teams. Look for the Cardinals to finish strong and play a whole lot of spoiler.\\n\\n30. New England Patriots 2-8 (28)\\n\\nThe Patriots tried to win a game by hiding Mac Jones and their quarterbacks in general. They almost pulled it off with the running game dominating and short-handed defense making a lot of plays, but they didn\\'t see the results in Germany ahead of a tough bye for Bill Belichick.\\n\\n31. New York Giants 2-8 (30)\\n\\nThe Giants can just flush away this season without Daniel Jones and Tyrod Taylor. The injuries go to their offense early and remained relentless, and now their defense is falling apart, too. The question is, will Brian Daboll get a massive mulligan after his rookie playoff leadership?\\n\\n32. Carolina Panthers 1-8 (31)\\n\\nThe Panthers found better defense and special teams to keep them in the game in Chicago, but Bryce Young still can\\'t unlock a limited passing game and the offensive line and running game hasn\\'t help nearly enough.']\n",

            "Based on the information provided, Sridevi's portrayal of the character Mathangi in the 1987 film \"Kohinoor\" has been recognized for its cultural impact and has also been commemorated with a special award after her passing. The character Mathangi was a strong and determined woman who stood up against social injustice, and her portrayal left a lasting impression on the audience. However, specific details about the award can't be determined from the given context alone. Thus, referring to posthumous honors mentioned in the Times of India report, we can conclude that the character Mathangi from \"Kohinoor\" has significant cultural recognition and was honored after Sridevi's death.\n",

            "            Question: Considering the information from a BBC article detailing Sridevi's achievements in the Indian film industry and a Times of India report on her posthumous honors, which single character from a film portrayed by Sridevi has been recognized for its cultural impact and has also been commemorated with a special award after her passing?\n",
            "            Context: [\"When Noora Niasari was five years old, she lived in a women’s shelter with her Iranian mother. They were fleeing family violence in a country that wasn’t entirely familiar, trying to make a new life.\\n\\nThat personal experience has informed Niasari’s debut feature, Shayda, which has been storming the global festival circuit since it premiered at Sundance film festival in January, winning an audience award. Released in Australia on 5 October, the film has already claimed the top prize at CinefestOz, opened the Melbourne international film festival, and been selected to represent Australia in the international film category at the Oscars.\\n\\nIt’s a sensational reception for a first film, particularly given the specificity of its story: Shayda is a dramatisation of Niasari’s early life, set in the Iranian diaspora community of suburban Melbourne. “It was something I had experienced, but I hadn’t really seen on screen before,” Niasari says of the movie she started thinking about straight after finishing film school. “But I first had to ask my mum for her permission and participation, because I had such a blurry memory of that time.”\\n\\nNiasari asked her mother to write her memoirs, which took six months; that writing formed the basis of the first incarnation of Shayda’s script. Shayda evolved over time – and it’s not always a direct mirror of what happened to them both – but “it is very emotionally true to our experience”.\\n\\nExecutive produced by Cate Blanchett, Niasari’s movie tells the story of Shayda (Zar Amir Ebrahimi), an Iranian immigrant in Melbourne who leaves her abusive husband Hossein (Osamah Sami) with her daughter Mona (Selina Zahednia) in tow. Shayda finds refuge in a women’s shelter where the kindly Joyce (Leah Purcell) protects and guides her through the tough legal process of a custody fight.\\n\\nZar Amir Ebrahimi and Selina Zahednia as Shayda and Mona. Photograph: Miff\\n\\nIt’s a tender and revealing film that balances Shayda’s discovery of inner strength with the sacrifices she makes for her daughter, as she tries to create a new family for her. It’s understated, relatable and drawn from such personal memories that Niasara describes working on it as “long-term exposure therapy”. Even doing interviews to promote the movie is difficult. “I have to sit with it and process it,” she says.\\n\\n“But the thing is, now that it’s a film, it has a really different energy in the world. People bring their own experiences to it, it’s a very universal experience. We’ve screened it in Europe, North America and Australia and there is a real sense that it connects beyond my mother and I, beyond our experience. It’s not about us any more. That feels liberating and cathartic.”\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Saved for Later Free newsletter Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shayda’s story may be centred on escaping abuse and fighting for custody of her child, but it’s also about friendship, music, dance, laughter and reclaiming freedom. There’s something elementally hopeful about the film.\\n\\n“I always wanted to find that balance in the story because … it’s life, there are ups and downs,” she says. A large part of the film is devoted to the character holding on to the rituals of Persian New Year, and finding a way to connect with her culture amid the upheaval.\\n\\n“For her, that’s through music and poetry and dance, and sharing that with her daughter. It became fundamental to the story. That was how I grew up as well. We’re in the Australian suburbs but I lived in a Persian house with my mum’s cooking and music.\\n\\n‘The world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now; it’s not just me looking at my mum in admiration,’ says Niasari. Photograph: Miff\\n\\n“I grew up with all of the beauty of our culture. So I had a natural inclination to include those moments [in the film]. You can feel the joyous moments even deeper when you have that tension or darkness around it.”\\n\\nIt has been a year since 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini died in custody, after being arrested for allegedly not complying with the country’s hijab laws. Her death led to a huge wave of popular unrest in Iran; Niasari hopes renewed international awareness of Iranian women’s resistance will lead to more stories being told.\\n\\n“The world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now; it’s not just me looking at my mum in admiration. Shayda is just one of those women who happened to leave Iran and make her own sacrifices and her own life.\\n\\n“It’s more and more important to showcase the diaspora experience as well, especially given what’s happening in the world with displacement, exile and migration due to conditions in the country. So, I’m really optimistic about the storytellers coming through and being able to tell a different kind of story.”\", \"The IMF. in its latest update. has said that India is one of the large emerging economies that has been doing better than expected.\\n\\nThe IMF said India has been doing better for a while now and that India is, in fact, one of the growth engines in the world economy at this point.\\n\\nThe IMF said important divergences are appearing. The slowdown is more pronounced in advanced economies than in emerging markets and developing economies. Among the advanced economies, the US has been revised up, with resilient consumption and investment, while the euro area has been revised down, as tighter monetary policy and the energy crisis took a toll.\\n\\nThere is divergence also among emerging markets and developing economies, with China facing growing headwinds, while Brazil, India. and Russia are revised up.\\n\\nAfter two years of rapid economic growth in 2021 and 2022, the near-term economic outlook for India is for continued rapid expansion during 2023-24, underpinned by strong growth in private consumption and investment, S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a recent update.\\n\\nThe acceleration of foreign direct investment inflows into India over the past decade reflects the favourable long-term growth outlook for the Indian economy, helped by a youthful demographic profile and rapidly rising urban household incomes.\\n\\nIndia's nominal GDP measured in USD terms is forecast to rise from $3.5 trillion in 2022 to $7.3 trillion by 2030. This rapid pace of economic expansion would result in the size of the Indian GDP exceeding the Japanese GDP by 2030, making India the second largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.\\n\\nBy 2022, the size of the Indian GDP had already become larger than the GDP of the UK and also France. By 2030, India's GDP is also forecast to surpass Germany, the research said.\\n\\nThe long-term outlook for the Indian economy is supported by a number of key growth drivers. An important positive factor for India is its large and fast-growing middle class, which is helping to drive consumer spending.\\n\\nThe rapidly growing Indian domestic consumer market as well as its large industrial sector have made India an increasingly important investment destination for a wide range of multinationals in many sectors, including manufacturing, infrastructure and services, the report said.\\n\\nThe digital transformation of India that is currently underway is expected to accelerate the growth of e-commerce, changing the retail consumer market landscape over the next decade. This is attracting leading global multinationals in technology and e-commerce to the Indian market.\\n\\nBy 2030, 1.1 billion people in India will have internet access, more than doubling from the estimated 500 million internet users in 2020. The rapid growth of e-commerce and the shift to 4G and 5G smartphone technology will boost home-grown unicorns.\\n\\nThe large increase in FDI inflows to India that has been evident over the past five years is also continuing with strong momentum evident even during the pandemic years of 2020-2022.\\n\\nIndia's strong FDI inflows have been boosted by large inflows of investments from global technology MNCs such as Google and Facebook that are attracted to India's large, fast-growing domestic consumer market, as well as a strong upturn in foreign direct investment inflows from manufacturing firms.\\n\\nOverall, India is expected to continue to be one of the world's fastest growing economies over the next decade. This will make India one of the most important long-term growth markets for multinationals in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing industries such as autos, electronics and chemicals to services industries such as banking, insurance, asset management, health care and information technology, it added.\\n\\nBrahma Chellaney, professor of strategic studies at the New Delhi-based Center for Policy Research, wrote in a recent article that as India's geopolitical, economic and cultural clout grows, so does its global footprint. China's “decline,” as some have begun to call the conclusion of the country's four-decade-long economic boom, opens new opportunities for the Indian economy and other developing and emerging countries.\\n\\nEarlier this year, India reached another milestone when its population officially surpassed that of China, which had been the world's most populous country for more than 300 years.\\n\\nWhile China's shrinking, rapidly aging population is likely to impede economic growth and may curtail its geopolitical ambitions, India -- one of the world's youngest countries, with a median age of 28.2 -- is poised to reap a huge demographic dividend, the article said.\\n\\nBut the driving force behind India's emergence as a major global power is its rapid economic growth. While India's gross domestic product is still smaller than China's, the country is currently the world's fastest-growing major economy and is projected to account for 12.9 per cent of global growth over the next five years, surpassing the United States' 11.3 per cent share, the article said.\\n\\nThe seventeenth round of the FICCI-IBA survey was carried out for the period January to June 2023. A total of 24 banks including public sector, private sector and foreign banks participated in the survey. These banks together represent about 79 per cent of the banking industry, as classified by asset size.\\n\\nThe Indian economy posted an impressive 7.2 per cent growth in the financial year ended March 2023 and 7.8 per cent in first quarter of current fiscal year. Credit growth also continued to rise, signalling robust demand conditions in the Indian economy, as well as banks' improved appetite towards retail borrowers.\\n\\nThe health of the banking sector has witnessed an encouraging turnaround, marked by healthier bank balance sheets and gross NPA ratio at a decade low.\\n\\nThe survey findings show that long term credit demand has seen continued growth in sectors such as Infrastructure, textiles and chemicals. food processing and metals.\\n\\nIron & steel have also witnessed accelerated long-term loan disbursements in the past six months. Infrastructure is witnessing an increase in credit flow with 67 per cent of the respondents indicating an increase in long-term loans as against 57 per cent in the previous round.\\n\\nThe survey suggests that the outlook on expectation on growth of non-food industry credit over next six months is optimistic with 42 per cent of the participating banks expecting non-food industry credit growth to be above 12 per cent (as compared to 36 per cent in the previous round).\\n\\nRajan Jain, Head, Credit Research, SBI Caps, said in a note that whether the yield curve dynamics mean the US is moving to a structurally higher-rate economy vs. post GFC normal remains a moot question, with important implications for investment demand and system risk.\\n\\nThese movements have had a cascading effect on global economies, which have seen routs in their respective bond markets, besides a fresh round of currency depreciation.\\n\\nEmerging market economies with large volumes of USD denominated debt are especially vulnerable as they could be caught in a vicious circle of their external debt (in local currency terms) ballooning due to strong DXY and their servicing ability being impaired by tepid economic activity owing to high rates. Even advanced economies have felt the heat, and the ECB etc. have maintained a hawkish narrative, Jain said.\\n\\nAnother developing story seems to be the greenshoots of recovery in China backed by domestic consumption in the Golden week, and tourism related to the Asian Games. For now, these seem to buttressed on stimulus and base effects as China is now fully open.\\n\\nThe long-term trajectory remains to be seen. In any case, for now this has provided a floor for commodity prices, especially base metals. Fickle commodity prices will also be victims of fresh geopolitical tensions in West Asia, which has pushed up Brent crude. Food prices could also play truant with climate change affecting cropping area worldwide: sugar and rice prices are booming, the note said.\\n\\nIn this challenging environment, Indian real GDP growth, estimated to be 6.2 per cent y/y in real terms in FY24, is resilient. High frequency indicators suggest strong construction and infrastructure activity, and soaring urban demand.\\n\\nManufacturing production has been unusually strong in Q2FY24, especially in infrastructure-oriented structures such as cement and steel. Power supply grew vastly in Q2 after a tepid Q1, helped by a dry August 2023 and buzzing industrial activity.\\n\\nBoth the Union and States have front ended capex in H1FY24, and this remains the engine of expansion. Capital expenditure was up 48 per cent y/y for the Union in the same period. Reports suggest capex of major states was also up 45 per cent y/y in 5MFY24.\\n\\nCarrying forward this capex in H2FY24 would be important to sustain the multiplier. The fiscal deficit for the 5MFY24 stood at 36% of the FY24BE. Gross direct tax revenue experienced a substantial increase of 18 per cent y/y up to October 9, allaying concerns of fiscal slippage, the note said.\", 'Beyoncé ruled the box office this weekend.\\n\\nHer concert picture, “ Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” opened in first place with $21 million in North American ticket sales, according to estimates from AMC Theatres Sunday.\\n\\nThe post-Thanksgiving, early December box office is notoriously slow, but “Renaissance” defied the odds. Not accounting for inflation, it’s the first time a film has opened over $20 million on this weekend in 20 years (since “The Last Samurai”).\\n\\nBeyoncé wrote, directed and produced “Renaissance,” which is focused on the tour for her Grammy-winning album. It debuted in 2,539 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, as well as 94 international territories, where it earned $6.4 million from 2,621 theaters.\\n\\n“On behalf of AMC Theatres Distribution and the entire theatrical industry, we thank Beyoncé for bringing this incredible film directly to her fans,” said Elizabeth Frank, AMC Theatres executive vice president of worldwide programming, in a statement. “To see it resonate with fans and with film critics on a weekend that many in the industry typically neglect is a testament to her immense talent, not just as a performer, but as a producer and director.”\\n\\nDespite several other new releases including “Godzilla Minus One,” the Hindi-language “Animal,” Angel Studios’ sci-fi thriller “The Shift,” and Lionsgate’s John Woo-directed revenge pic “Silent Night,” it was a slow weekend overall. Films in the top 10 are expected to gross only $85 million in total.\\n\\nBut it was in this traditional “lull” that AMC Theatres found a good opportunity for “Renaissance” to shine.\\n\\n“They chose a great weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “There was competition but it was from very different kinds of movies.”\\n\\nThough “Renaissance” did not come close to matching the $92.8 million debut of “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” in October, it’s still a very good start for a concert film. No one expected “Renaissance” to match “The Eras Tour,” which is wrapping up its theatrical run soon with over $250 million globally. Prior to Swift, the biggest concert film debuts (titles held by Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber for their 2008 and 2011 films) had not surpassed the unadjusted sum of $32 million.\\n\\nThe 39-city, 56-show “Renaissance” tour, which kicked off in Stockholm, Sweden in May and ended in Kansas City, Missouri in the fall, made over $500 million and attracted over 2.7 million concertgoers. Swift’s ongoing “Eras Tour,” with 151 dates, is expected to gross some $1.4 billion.\\n\\nBoth Beyoncé and Swift chose to partner with AMC Theatres to distribute their films, as opposed to a traditional studio. Both superstars have been supportive of one another, making splashy appearances at the other’s premieres. Both had previously released films on Netflix (“Miss Americana” and “Homecoming”). And both are reported to be receiving at least 50% of ticket sales.\\n\\nMovie tickets to the show were more expensive than average, around $23.32 versus Swift’s $20.78, according to data firm EntTelligence.\\n\\nCritics and audiences gave “Renaissance” glowing reviews – it’s sitting at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and got a coveted A+ CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences who were polled. EntTelligence also estimates that the audience, around 900,000 strong, skewed a little older than Swift’s.\\n\\n“To have two concert films topping the chart in a single year is pretty unprecedented,” Dergarabedian said.\\n\\nBut to compare them too closely would be a mistake.\\n\\n“Taylor Swift was a total outlier and the result of a very specific set of circumstances,” he said. “These two films are similar in genre only. “\\n\\nLionsgate’s “ The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes ” fell to second place in its third weekend with an estimated $14.5 million. The prequel has now earned over $121 million domestically.\\n\\n“ Godzilla Minus One ” took third place on the North American charts with $11 million from 2,308 locations — the biggest opening for a foreign film in the U.S. this year. The well-reviewed Japanese blockbuster distributed by Toho International cost only $15 million to produce and has already earned $23 million in Japan. Toho’s 33rd Godzilla film is set in the aftermath of World War II, stars Ryunosuke Kamiki and was directed by Takashi Yamazaki.\\n\\n“This year, we made a concentrated effort to answer the demand of the marketplace and make Godzilla globally accessible across many different platforms,” said Koji Ueda, President of Toho Global, in a statement.\\n\\n“Trolls Band Together” landed in fourth place in its third weekend with $7.6 million, bringing its domestic total to $74.8 million.\\n\\nFifth place went to Disney’s “Wish,” which fell 62% from its underwhelming first weekend, with $7.4 million from 3,900 locations. Globally, it’s now made $81.6 million. The studio’s other major film in theaters, “The Marvels” is also winding down in its fourth weekend with a disastrous global tally of $197 million against the reported $300 million it cost to make and market the superhero film.\\n\\nIn its second weekend, Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” earned an estimated $7.1 million from 3,500 locations. Produced by Apple Original Films and distributed by Sony Pictures, the film starring Joaquin Phoenix has now made $45.7 million domestically against a $200 million budget.\\n\\nThings should pick up in the final weeks of 2023, with films like “Wonka” and “The Color Purple” yet to come. The industry is looking at a $9 billion year — still trailing the $11 billion pre-pandemic norm, but a marked improvement from the last few years. And there are still many solid options for moviegoers, as the industry’s awards season gets into full swing.\\n\\n“We had a slow Thanksgiving and we’re having a pretty slow weekend this weekend, but it’s a great weekend to be a moviegoer in terms of the breadth and depth of the movies out there,” Dergarabedian said.\\n\\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\\n\\n1. “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” $21 million.\\n\\n2. “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,” $14.5 million.\\n\\n3. “Godzilla Minus One,” $11 million.\\n\\n4. “Trolls Band Together,” $7.6 million.\\n\\n5. “Wish,” $7.4 million.\\n\\n6. “Napoleon,” $7.1 million.\\n\\n7. “Animal,” $6.1 million.\\n\\n8. “The Shift,” $4.4 million.\\n\\n9. “Silent Night,” $3 million.\\n\\n10. “Thanksgiving,” $2.6 million.']\n",

South Africa\\'s dominant 27-13 victory at Twickenham proved to be the last game in charge for Eddie Jones, the coach who had taken England to the 2019 World Cup final. In his place, Steve Borthwick was hired, and he\\'s just one game away from repeating that feat.\\n\\nEngland\\'s form at this tournament has been perfect — at face value. Argentina, Japan, Chile, Samoa and Fiji have all provided highlights — Los Pumas are also in the semi-finals — and England have beaten all of them. However, only Japan and Chile were defeated with bonus points, and the narrow wins over both Samoa and Fiji in their last two games showed that England are certainly gettable.\\n\\nIn short, this semi-final requires a huge step up in quality for Borthwick\\'s side, and that\\'s why we think that the Springboks will be victorious at the Stade de France. South Africa have already shown they can match, and beat, the world\\'s best, and we think that they\\'ll do the latter in Saint-Denis.', 'Four years ago, Rassie Erasmus delivered one of the great rugby speeches ahead of the 2019 World Cup final.\\n\\n“You don’t have the right today to worry about your mistakes,” Erasmus said before the Springboks sealed a stunning 32-12 victory over England to claim their third William Webb Ellis Cup.\\n\\n“If you worry about your mistakes today, you’ve got ego problems.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\\n\\n“You are not representing yourself today.

It was exactly a week after he\\'d forced out his hand-picked successor as CEO, ex-Amazon executive Dave Clark, so Petersen could once again run the show. Sitting in the first few rows of attendees was Clark, the man he\\'d ousted just a year into the job. Petersen was surprised that he showed up, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Days earlier, Petersen had excoriated Clark, alleging he\\'d secretly expanded the company\\'s headcount and taken on unnecessary leases without Petersen or the board\\'s knowledge. On X, formerly known as Twitter, Petersen wrote, \"Strategic Plan, Day 1: Make better decisions!\" With Clark sitting a few feet away, Petersen struck a different tone. \"I think we\\'re going to look back and go, \\'Wow I\\'d probably do that all over again because of the progress that we\\'ve made,\\'\" Petersen said, in an interview on stage. Doing it over again would seem to suggest hiring Clark wasn\\'t a bad decision. Petersen went even further, personally commending Clark for orchestrating the $1.3 billion purchase of Deliverr from Shopify , picking up supply chain technology for last-mile deliveries. That deal was announced in May. \"I\\'m very, very lucky because I wouldn\\'t have had the courage to go and do that acquisition, but I give all the credit in the world to Dave Clark,\" Petersen said. \"There\\'s no one probably in the world who would be better at running that last-mile e-com fulfillment network. Personally, I don\\'t have any experience and I would\\'ve been pretty intimidated to try and go pull that off.\" The mixed messaging from the 43-year-old Flexport founder underscores the dysfunction surrounding the sudden firing of Clark, who previously spent 23 years at Amazon and built its mammoth logistics network on the way to becoming one of Jeff Bezos\\' top deputies. It\\'s also indicative of a bigger challenge facing Flexport, whose software is designed to simplify the process of transporting goods. The company was valued at $8 billion by private investors in early 2022, just as the economy was turning and the 10-year tech bull market was coming to an end. As a high-valued company backed by powerful VCs, Flexport has been trying to simultaneously operate in Silicon Valley startup growth mode while also restraining expenses to reflect the new economic realities and to cope with supply chain bottlenecks. This account is based on conversations with people close to Clark and Petersen. They requested anonymity to discuss confidential interactions. Their perspectives have been corroborated by internal documents and communications reviewed by CNBC. Petersen has publicly said Clark overspent, overhired and overpromised, something his allies echoed to CNBC. He burned through cash and kept Petersen in the dark about key financials and an ambitious expansion into providing end-to-end supply chain tools for small and medium-sized businesses. People close to Petersen pointed to a number of previously unreported incidents that eroded his confidence in Clark. But documents viewed by CNBC and sources close to Clark undermine those claims. They show that Clark, who arrived when the company was struggling to bill customers and track containers, worked closely with the board and Petersen to implement decisions that Flexport now suggests were ill-advised. Evidence to support Flexport\\'s claims of financial mismanagement is lacking, raising questions about whether that narrative was put forward to justify Clark\\'s exit. A Flexport spokesperson rejected that characterization. \"Ryan Petersen returned as CEO in order to restore Flexport\\'s culture of customer engagement, and drive the growth and cost discipline required to return the company to profitability,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\\n\\nGet IPO ready\\n\\nClark arrived last year as the perfect hire for a tech startup trying to disrupt the age-old logistics industry. He\\'d built Amazon\\'s logistics unit into a juggernaut that rivaled carriers like UPS and FedEx .\\n\\nRyan Petersen, chief executive officer of Flexport, participates in a panel discussion during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nSince 2021, Petersen had been seeking a successor for Flexport\\'s then-operating chief, Sanne Manders, in part to address what several ex-employees described as lingering issues with the company\\'s troubled billing processes. Fixing that was Clark\\'s job. Petersen and Clark worked together as co-CEOs for the first six months. In March, Petersen transitioned to executive chairman. The co-CEO arrangement would free Petersen up to do what he loved – \"getting beers with customers,\" in the words of two former Flexport employees. Clark, a self-described \"builder at heart,\" was at the wheel. Among Clark\\'s goals was to help Petersen prepare Flexport for an IPO, something the company had discussed doing within a two- to three-year window, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents viewed by CNBC. \"There\\'s a perfect complement of skill sets,\" Petersen told Forbes in June 2022. \"Mine are much more creative, zero-to-one founder time, and Dave is the supreme executor and a legend in the supply chain world.\" Buying Deliverr was meant to be the first step in turning Flexport into a more full-scale logistics service for its customers. Shopify had acquired Deliverr in May 2022 for $2.1 billion. But the e-commerce software company was getting hammered by Wall Street as its Covid pandemic pop faded. By January 2023, CEO Tobias Lutke knew he needed to get rid of Deliverr. Around that time, Lutke first approached Petersen to float the possibility of a deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Petersen told Clark he should engage with Shopify\\'s team, according to a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations. Initial talks fell apart, but resumed when Flexport executives learned that Shopify was about to execute deep cost cuts and was eager to sell Deliverr. Clark and Petersen flew to Miami to meet with Shopify\\'s leadership. As a transaction was nearing, Clark, who had a reputation as a deft negotiator, got Shopify, which was already an investor in Flexport, to sweeten it with $40 million in cash and the framework for a $260 million convertible note that could help Flexport on its path to an IPO, according to an internal document analyzing the deal. The sale would be announced alongside Shopify\\'s first-quarter earnings report on May 4. \"We did not change the terms of a deal or rush it just to have it line up with an earnings call,\" Shopify said in a statement. With Flexport, \"we are tightly mission-aligned to ensure the success of our merchants, which is why we chose to deepen our partnership with them earlier this year.\" The night before the announcement, Petersen appeared at a \"Tech Talk\" at Flexport\\'s Bellevue, Washington, office to pitch the \"Flexport vision\" to hundreds of people. An attendee asked Petersen whether Flexport would ever get into last-mile logistics. Petersen paused, glanced at his watch, and said to keep an eye on the morning news, according to a Flexport employee who witnessed the exchange and by a person who was told independently. The comment alarmed Clark and Flexport executives, who were concerned that Petersen had disclosed material nonpublic information about a publicly traded company, according to people familiar with the matter. Petersen didn\\'t respond to calls or messages from CNBC, and the company declined to make him available for an interview. A Flexport spokesperson didn\\'t respond to CNBC\\'s question about whether Petersen was aware of concerns about his statement at the event.\\n\\nThe \\'whistleblower\\'\\n\\nClark\\'s first quarterly board meeting as sole CEO was June 1. His second was Aug. 31, days before he was forced out. The board was made up largely of investors who were betting on the founder. It included Founders Fund\\'s Trae Stephens, who had helped start defense-tech firm Anduril Industries, and Michael Ronen, who left SoftBank in 2020. Andreessen Horowitz was represented by Bob Swan, an operating partner at the firm and former CEO of Intel .\\n\\nBob Swan, then-interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Intel Corp., reacts during the inauguration of the company\\'s research and development facility in Bengaluru, India, on November 15, 2018. Samyukta Lakshmi | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nFor much of the summer, Clark had pushed then-CFO Kenny Wagers and his financial planning and analysis team to realign Flexport\\'s year-end and 18-month forecasts, according to a person close to the situation. The reasons were obvious. At the beginning of 2022, it cost around $14,500 to move a single container across the Pacific. By late 2022, prices of ocean freight from Asia to the U.S. West Coast were down 90% from a year earlier, due largely to weakening global demand. Because Flexport makes money by charging fees for the transportation of goods, the company\\'s business was getting hammered. But Wagers and Stuart Leung, a Flexport finance executive and a close Petersen ally, were reluctant to pare back forecasts, frustrating Clark, who felt those projections were overly optimistic. Wagers and Leung did not respond to CNBC\\'s interview requests. Clark ultimately prevailed, but the revised forecasts distressed Petersen. Clark, Petersen and Wagers met in Texas in mid-August to fine-tune the forecasts. A source close to Petersen told CNBC that the meeting went poorly for Clark because a so-called whistleblower — identified as a senior finance executive — stepped forward shortly before it began and told Petersen that the numbers being presented were \"not real.\" The source referred to the senior finance executive as a whistleblower because of the information he disclosed to Petersen about Clark. Documents seen by CNBC and conversations with people with direct knowledge of the board meeting make it clear that there were no substantiated whistleblower actions or allegations of financial impropriety. Flexport\\'s spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"There was no whistleblower nor was there any financial misconduct. Any allegations to the contrary are completely false.\" On Sept. 15, shortly after CNBC spoke with the Petersen source, legal counsel for Clark sent a cease-and-desist letter to Flexport. The letter, viewed by CNBC, instructed the company to preserve and retain all communications involving Clark\\'s departure. The letter disputes the existence of a whistleblower and lists specific allegations as false and defamatory, including Petersen\\'s claims that Clark was an unfit CEO because he overextended the company\\'s lease obligations. Five hours after the letter was sent, the source close to Petersen contacted CNBC and asked to retract their statements and all details related to Clark\\'s firing or about the so-called whistleblower. CNBC declined to retract his statements. Petersen has since deleted several of his posts criticizing Clark.\\n\\nDave Clark, Amazon\\'s former senior vice president of worldwide operations. Lindsey Wasson | Reuters\\n\\nThe letter cited two documents that had been presented to the board. Both were viewed by CNBC. The first was a pre-acquisition financial analysis of the Deliverr deal, and the second was a review of Flexport\\'s first-quarter numbers. The Deliverr analysis was presented by the co-CEOs to the board for their approval and was shaped by multiple prior board meetings. Clark\\'s camp suggested that other factors may have led to the abrupt firing. For example, politics. Days after Clark was ousted, Petersen sent him a message — seen by CNBC — blasting one of his key female executives for wasting her days at the company on \"far left-wing political activism.\" The executive is a registered Republican. Stephens, the Founders Fund partner, also shared his contempt for that executive weeks before Clark\\'s departure, a person familiar with the board told CNBC. Stephens did not respond to CNBC\\'s request for comment. Petersen is also a venture partner at Founders Fund, the firm started by Peter Thiel, who was a prominent supporter of President Trump\\'s 2016 campaign and more recently bankrolled Senate candidates in Ohio and Arizona. Many of Thiel\\'s closest confidantes at Founders Fund and elsewhere in the venture industry are outspoken conservatives. Petersen\\'s sole public political contribution in 2023 was to a Democratic political action committee associated with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. He doesn\\'t talk much about politics on social media or in interviews. Clark has donated to candidates on both sides of the aisle. Upon his departure, The Wall Street Journal reported that he was considering running for governor of Texas, but two people familiar with his thinking say it\\'s not happening anytime soon. Flexport told CNBC that an employee\\'s politics are not relevant in personnel decisions. \"Ryan Petersen does not care at all about anyone\\'s political or personal affiliations. That is their business,\" the spokesperson said. \"It is inappropriate for any employee to spend an excessive amount of time during work hours on activities unrelated to their role.\" A person familiar with the female executive said her noncorporate endeavors were largely related to charitable organizations. Clark has largely remained silent since he was forced to resign on Sept. 5, though in private he\\'s expressed frustration at how his former team was being treated by Flexport, according to people close to him. Many of his allies at Amazon who joined him at Flexport were summarily fired by Petersen shortly after his departure. On Sept. 13, Flexport\\'s chief legal counsel, Chris Ferro, contacted Clark. Ferro told him that his resignation a week prior had not been accepted, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Instead, Ferro told Clark that Flexport\\'s board met the day after Clark resigned and voted to fire him for cause, the person familiar said. Ferro said the board minutes didn\\'t yet reflect why Clark had been fired, the person said. Ferro allegedly told Clark that Flexport would be willing to give him a block of 2 million shares — worth millions of dollars — if he signed a separation agreement that included nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses. Clark declined, the person said. Shortly after Flexport reached out with the offer, Clark took the stage at the same supply chain conference in Phoenix that Petersen spoke at earlier in the day. He didn\\'t hold back. \"The only thing I really regret from the past year was I sort of picked the wrong founder,\" Clark said. \"Basically, it was a place of extending my reputational halo to a group that, in my opinion, didn\\'t deserve it. Largely, because about half the team was let go last week on Friday, the most brutal nonseverance packages I\\'ve ever seen in my life. It was about as disrespectful a way as humanly possible.\"\\n\\nAmazon showdown\\n\\nOn top of the public relations fallout from the Clark saga and any legal wrangling that may follow, Flexport faces staffing turnover and a growing threat from Clark\\'s former employer. Flexport recently ousted Wagers as CFO and lost its human resources chief. More layoffs are expected soon, sources said, after the company cut 20% of its staff in January. On Sept. 12, almost a week after Clark was fired, Flexport executives convened in Seattle to launch an end-to-end supply chain service that would allow sellers to move their products from factories to customers\\' doorsteps through integrations with major online marketplaces. The project was spearheaded by Parisa Sadrzadeh, an executive vice president at Flexport who Clark had poached from Amazon\\'s logistics unit. Earlier in the day, and just up the street from Flexport\\'s event, Amazon had unveiled a strikingly similar service in front of approximately 2,200 attendees at its annual Accelerate seller conference. Flexport had planned to have a booth onsite but was told it couldn\\'t be an exhibitor, which some staffers suspected was due to the competing supply chain products, according to a person familiar with the matter. Flexport discussed securing exhibit space at Accelerate months earlier but didn\\'t meet all the requirements to participate, and its launch wasn\\'t mentioned in those conversations, Amazon said. Flexport\\'s event was underwhelming. In a conference room, about 50 people looked on as Sadrzadeh debuted Flexport\\'s service and then introduced Petersen, who spoke for roughly 20 minutes, according to Burak Yolga, co-founder of a digital freight forwarding company who was in attendance. \"Flexport announced pretty much the same thing that Amazon announced,\" Yolga said in an interview. He said he left after about a half-hour. The company paid rapper Nelly $150,000 to perform at the event. But in the days leading up to the launch, Petersen opted to squash the performance because the optics were bad after his post about rescinding job offers, a person familiar with the matter said. Despite canceling the event, Flexport still paid the artist. WATCH: Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen on reinvesting profits', 'Meta has a moderation bias problem, not just a ‘bug,’ that’s suppressing Palestinian voices Instagram users suspect Meta of shadowbanning content about Palestine. The platform has a history of inherent bias.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Palestinian-American filmmaker Khitam Jabr posted a handful of Reels about her family’s trip to the West Bank. In the short travel vlogs, Jabr shared snippets of Palestinian culture, from eating decadent meals to dancing at her niece’s wedding.\\n\\n“I hadn’t been in a decade, so it’s just like, life abroad,” Jabr told TechCrunch.\\n\\n“I would get [anti-Palestine] comments,” she recalled. “And I couldn’t respond [to them] or use my account for 24 hours. I wasn’t even posting anything about the occupation. But fast forward to now and the same shit’s happening.”\\n\\nIn the aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israelis, Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes and total blockade — cutting access to electricity, water and vital supplies — have devastated Gaza. In response to the escalating violence, Meta said that it is closely monitoring its platforms for violations and may inadvertently flag certain content, but it never intends to “suppress a particular community or point of view.” Content praising or supporting Hamas, which governs Gaza and is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, is expressly forbidden on Meta’s platforms.\\n\\nAs the humanitarian crisis in Gaza grows more dire, many social media users suspect Instagram of censoring content about the besieged Palestinian territory, even if that content doesn’t support Hamas. Users have also complained that they’ve been harassed and reported for posting content about Palestine, regardless of whether or not it violates Meta’s policies. Jabr, for example, suspects that Instagram restricted her for 24 hours because other users reported her Palestine travel videos. Most recently, Instagram users accused Meta of “shadowbanning” their Stories about Palestine.\\n\\nIt’s the latest in a lengthy history of incidents on Meta platforms that reflect an inherent bias against Palestinian users in its processes, as documented by years of complaints from both inside and outside the company. The company may not intentionally suppress specific communities, but its moderation practices often disproportionately affect Palestinian users.\\n\\nFor instance, Meta struggles to navigate the cultural and linguistic nuances of Arabic, a language with over 25 dialects, and has been criticized for neglecting to adequately diversify its language resources. The company’s black-and-white policies often preclude it from effectively moderating any nuanced topic, like content that discusses violence without condoning it. Advocacy groups have also raised concerns that Meta’s partnerships with government agencies, such as the Israeli Cyber Unit, politically influence the platform’s policy decisions.\\n\\nDuring the last violent outbreak between Hamas and Israel in 2021, a report commissioned by Meta and conducted by a third party concluded that the company’s actions had an “adverse human rights impact” on Palestinian users’ right to freedom of expression and political participation.\\n\\nMeta communications director Andy Stone declined to comment on the record, and pointed TechCrunch to Meta’s newsroom post about the conflict, which was updated on Oct. 18 with a statement addressing the shadowbanning claims.\\n\\n“Our policies are designed to keep people safe on our apps while giving everyone a voice,” the post stated. “We apply these policies equally around the world and there is no truth to the suggestion that we are deliberately suppressing voice … We can make errors and that is why there is an appeals process for people to tell us when they think we have made the wrong decision, so we can look into it.”\\n\\nThe belief that Meta shadowbans, or limits the visibility of, content about Palestine is not new. In an Instagram Story last year, supermodel and activist Bella Hadid, who is of Palestinian descent, alleged that Instagram “disabled” her from posting content on her Story “pretty much only when it is Palestine based.” She said she gets “immediately shadowbanned” when she posts about Palestine, and her Story views drop by “almost 1 million.”\\n\\nAs soon as Kehlani got super vocal and changed her profile picture to “i stand with Palestine” she got shadowbanned.\\n\\nJust as they did to Bella Hadid. The propaganda is insane.\\n\\nTHEY TRY TO SILENCE US. DON’T STOP!!\\n\\nFREE PALESTINE. 🇵🇸🇵🇸 pic.twitter.com/4lUvZsUbiA — Sabby Targaryen 🐉 (@whoisitbad) October 14, 2023\\n\\nMeta blamed technical errors for the removal of posts about Palestine during the 2021 conflict. When reached for comment about these recent claims of shadowbanning, a representative for the company pointed TechCrunch to a Threads post by Stone.\\n\\n“We identified a bug impacting all Stories that re-shared Reels and Feed posts, meaning they weren’t showing up properly in people’s Stories tray, leading to significantly reduced reach,” Stone said. “This bug affected accounts equally around the globe and had nothing to do with the subject matter of the content — and we fixed it as quickly as possible.”\\n\\nBut many are frustrated that Meta continues to disproportionately suppress Palestinian voices. Leen Al Saadi, a Palestinian journalist currently based in Jordan and host of the podcast “Preserving Palestine,” said she is used to “constantly being censored.” Her Instagram account was restricted last year after she posted a trailer for the podcast’s first episode, which discussed a documentary about Palestinian street art under occupation.\\n\\n“Palestinians are currently undergoing two wars,” Al Saadi said. “The first is with their legal occupier. The second war is with the entire Western media landscape, and when I say the entire landscape, I mean social media.”\\n\\nMeta’s alleged shadowbanning\\n\\nInstagram users accuse Meta of suppressing more than just Stories related to Palestine.\\n\\nCreators say engagement on their posts tanked specifically after they publicly condemned Israel’s response to the Hamas attack as excessively violent. Some, like Jabr, say they were restricted from posting or going live, while others say Instagram flagged their content as “sensitive,” limiting its reach. Users also allege their posts were flagged as “inappropriate” and removed, even if the content adhered to Instagram’s Community Guidelines.\\n\\nMeta’s representative didn’t address the other accusations of censorship beyond just Story visibility and did not respond to TechCrunch’s follow-up questions. When asked for comment, Stone directed TechCrunch to Meta’s updated newsroom post, which said Meta identified and fixed a “bug” that prevented users from going live.\\n\\n“This was also a global issue that was fixed within a few hours. We understand people rely on these tools and we’re sorry to anyone who felt the impact of these issues,” the post stated.\\n\\nIt’s unclear if this “bug” impacted accounts posting content unrelated to Gaza. Instagram users have posted screenshots showing that Stories about Palestine have received significantly fewer views than other Stories posted on the same day, and allege that their view counts went back up when they posted content unrelated to the conflict.\\n\\nofc IG’s hiding my stories about Palestine, y’all see the difference? lmaoaoaoao pic.twitter.com/1iYIIKBhtN — ༒︎ (@arxbprince) October 15, 2023\\n\\nA user based in Egypt, who asked to stay anonymous for fear of harassment, said her posts usually get around 300 views, but when she started posting pro-Palestine content after the Hamas attack earlier this month, her stories would only get one to two views.\\n\\n“It happened to all my friends, too,” she continued. “Then we noticed that posting a random pic would get higher views. So by posting a random pic, then a pro-Palestine post, would increase the views.”\\n\\nAnother Instagram user based in the United Kingdom, who also asked to stay anonymous out of fear of harassment, said that his view count returned to normal when he posted a cat photo.\\n\\n“My stories went from 100s of views to zero or a handful,” he said. “I’ve had to post intermittent non-Gaza content in order to ‘release’ my stories to be viewed again.”\\n\\nIt isn’t just Stories. The Arab Center for Social Media Advancement (7amleh), which documents cases of Palestinian digital rights violations and works directly with social media companies to appeal violations, told TechCrunch it has received reports of Instagram inconsistently filtering comments containing the Palestinian flag emoji. Users report that Instagram has flagged comments containing the emoji as “potentially offensive,” hiding the comment.\\n\\nMeta initially did not respond to follow-up requests for comment. When asked for comment, Stone pointed TechCrunch to Meta’s updated newsroom post, which did not directly address issues related to comments containing the Palestinian flag.\\n\\nThe organization has also received countless reports of Meta flagging and restricting Arabic content, even if it’s posted by news outlets. Jalal Abukhater, 7amleh’s advocacy manager, said that the organization has documented multiple cases of journalists on Instagram reporting the same news in Arabic, Hebrew and English, but only getting flagged for their Arabic content.\\n\\n“It’s literally journalistic content, but the same wording in Hebrew and English does not get restricted,” Abukhater said. “As if there’s better moderation for those languages, and more careless moderation for Arabic content.”\\n\\nStone declined to comment on allegations of Meta disproportionately flagging Arabic news content, instead directing TechCrunch to the updated newsroom post — which did not directly address the allegations.\\n\\nAnd as the Intercept reported, Instagram and Facebook are flagging images of the al-Ahli Hospital, claiming that the content violates Meta’s Community Guidelines on nudity or sexual activity.\\n\\nThe Community Guidelines are enforced inconsistently, particularly when it comes to content related to Palestine. Al Saadi recently tried to report a comment that said she should be “raped” and “burned alive” — left in response to her comment on a CNN post about the conflict — but in screenshots reviewed by TechCrunch, Instagram said that it didn’t violate the platform’s Community Guidelines against violence or dangerous organizations.\\n\\n“The restrictions on content, especially the content that relates to Palestine, is heavily politicized,” Abukhater said. “It feeds into the bias against Palestinian narrative genuinely. It really takes the balance against Palestinians in a situation where there’s a huge asymmetry of power.”\\n\\nA history of suppression\\n\\nContent about Palestine is disproportionately scrutinized, as demonstrated during the last severe violent outbreak between Hamas and Israel two years ago. Amid the violence following the May 2021 court ruling to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem, users across Facebook and Instagram accused Meta of taking down posts and suspending accounts that voiced support for Palestinians.\\n\\nThe digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) described Meta’s actions in 2021 as “systemic censorship of Palestinian voices.” In its 2022 report of Palestinian digital rights, 7amleh said that Meta is “still the most restricting company” compared to other social media giants in the extent of its moderation of the Palestinian digital space.\\n\\nMeta forbids support of terrorist organizations, like most social media companies based in the U.S., but struggles to moderate content around it, from user discourse to journalistic updates. This policy, along with the company’s partnership with Israel to monitor posts that incite violence, complicates things for Palestinians living under Hamas’ governance. As EFF points out, something as simple as Hamas’ flag in the background of an image can result in a strike.\\n\\nJillian York, the director for international freedom of expression for EFF, blames automation and decisions made by “minimally trained humans” for the inconsistency. Meta’s zero tolerance policy and imprecise enforcement often suppress content from or about conflict zones, she said. The site’s moderation issues have negatively affected multiple non-English speaking regions, including Libya, Syria and Ukraine.\\n\\n“These rules can prevent people from sharing documentation of human rights violations, documentation of war crimes, even just news about what’s happening on the ground,” York continued. “And so I think that is what is the most problematic right now about that particular rule, and the way that it’s enforced.”\\n\\nOver the 13 days leading up to the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, 7amleh documented more than 500 reports of Palestinian “digital rights violations,” including the removal and restriction of content, hashtags and accounts related to the conflict.\\n\\nMeta blamed some of the instances of perceived censorship to technical issues, like one that prevented users in Palestine and Colombia from posting Instagram Stories. It attributed others to human error, like blocking the hashtag for Al-Aqsa Mosque, the holy site where Israeli police clashed with Ramadan worshippers, because it was mistaken for a terrorist organization. The company also blocked journalists in Gaza from WhatsApp without explanation.\\n\\nThe same month, a group of Facebook employees filed internal complaints accusing the company of bias against Arab and Muslim users. In internal posts obtained by BuzzFeed News, an employee attributed the bias to “years and years of implementing policies that just don’t scale globally.”\\n\\nAt the recommendation of its Oversight Board, Meta conducted a third-party due diligence report about the platform’s moderation during the May 2021 conflict. The report found that Arabic content was flagged as potentially violating at significantly higher rates than Hebrew content was, and was more likely to be erroneously removed. The report noted that Meta’s moderation system may not be as precise for Arabic content as it was for Hebrew content, because the latter is a “more standardized language,” and suggested that reviewers may lack the linguistic and cultural competence to understand less common Arabic dialects like Palestinian Arabic.\\n\\nHas anything improved?\\n\\nMeta committed to implementing policy changes based on the report’s recommendations, such as updating its keywords associated with dangerous organizations, disclosing government requests to remove content and launching a hostile speech classifier for Hebrew content. Abukhater added that Meta has improved its response to harassment, at least in comparison to other social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Although harassment and abuse are still rampant on Instagram and Facebook, he said, the company has been responsive to suspending accounts with patterns of targeting other users.\\n\\nThe company has also made more contact with regional Palestinian organizations since 2021, York added, but it’s been slow to implement recommendations from EFF and other advocacy groups. It’s “very clear” that Meta is not putting the same resources behind Arabic and other non-English languages, York said, compared to the attention Meta gives to countries that have the most regulatory pressure. Moderation of English and other European languages tends to be more comprehensive, for example, because the EU enforces the Digital Services Act.\\n\\nIn Meta’s response to the report, Miranda Sissons, the company’s director of human rights, said that Meta was “assessing the feasibility” of reviewing Arabic content by dialect. Sissons said that the company has “large and diverse teams” who understand “local cultural context across the region,” including in Palestine. Responding to the escalating violence earlier this month, Meta stated that it established a “special operations center” staffed with fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers to closely monitor and respond to violating content.\\n\\nDespite Meta’s apparent efforts to diversify its language resources, Arabic is still disproportionately flagged as violating — like in the case of journalists reporting news in multiple languages.\\n\\n“The balance of power is very fixed, in reality, between Israelis and Palestinians,” Abukhater said. “And this is something that today is reflected heavily on platforms like Meta, even though they have human rights teams releasing reports and trying to improve upon their policies. Whenever an escalation like the one we’re experiencing now happens, things just go back to zero.”\\n\\nAnd at times, Meta’s Arabic translations are completely inaccurate. This week, multiple Instagram users raised concerns over the platform mistranslating the relatively common Arabic phrase “Alhamdulillah,” or “Praise be to God.” In screen recordings posted online, users found that if they included “Palestinian” and the corresponding flag emoji in their Instagram bio along with the Arabic phrase, Instagram automatically translated their bio to “Palestinian terrorists – Praise be to Allah” or “Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom.” When users removed “Palestinian” and the flag emoji, Instagram translated the Arabic phrase to “Thank God.” Instagram users complained that the offensive mistranslation was active for hours before Meta appeared to correct it.\\n\\nShayaan Khan, a TikTok creator who posted a viral video about the mistranslation, told TechCrunch that Meta’s lack of cultural competence isn’t just offensive, it’s dangerous. He said that the “glitch” can fuel Islamophobic and racist rhetoric, which has already been exacerbated by the war in Gaza. Khan pointed to the fatal stabbing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian-American child whose death is being investigated as a hate crime.\\n\\nMeta did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment about the mistranslation. Abukhater said that Meta told 7amleh that a “bug” caused the mistranslation. In a statement to 404 Media, a Meta spokesperson said that the issue had been fixed.\\n\\n“We fixed a problem that briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations in some of our products,” the statement said, “We sincerely apologize that this happened.”\\n\\nAs the war continues, social media users have tried to find ways around the alleged shadowbanning on Instagram. Supposed loopholes include misspelling certain words, like “p@lestine” instead of “Palestine,” in hopes of bypassing any content filters. Users also share information about Gaza in text superimposed over unrelated images, like a cat photo, so it won’t be flagged as graphic or violent content. Creators have tried to include an emoji of the Israeli flag or tag their posts and Stories with #istandwithisrael, even if they don’t support the Israeli government, in hopes of gaming engagement.\\n\\nAl Saadi said that her frustration with Meta is common among Palestinians, both in occupied territories and across the diaspora.\\n\\n“All we’re asking for is to give us the exact same rights,” she said. “We’re not asking for more. We’re literally just asking Meta, Instagram, every single broadcast channel, every single media outlet, to just give us the respect that we deserve.”\\n\\nDominic-Madori Davis contributed to this story’s reporting.', 'Welcome to Startups Weekly.

It was exactly a week after he\\'d forced out his hand-picked successor as CEO, ex-Amazon executive Dave Clark, so Petersen could once again run the show. Sitting in the first few rows of attendees was Clark, the man he\\'d ousted just a year into the job. Petersen was surprised that he showed up, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Days earlier, Petersen had excoriated Clark, alleging he\\'d secretly expanded the company\\'s headcount and taken on unnecessary leases without Petersen or the board\\'s knowledge. On X, formerly known as Twitter, Petersen wrote, \"Strategic Plan, Day 1: Make better decisions!\" With Clark sitting a few feet away, Petersen struck a different tone. \"I think we\\'re going to look back and go, \\'Wow I\\'d probably do that all over again because of the progress that we\\'ve made,\\'\" Petersen said, in an interview on stage. Doing it over again would seem to suggest hiring Clark wasn\\'t a bad decision. Petersen went even further, personally commending Clark for orchestrating the $1.3 billion purchase of Deliverr from Shopify , picking up supply chain technology for last-mile deliveries. That deal was announced in May. \"I\\'m very, very lucky because I wouldn\\'t have had the courage to go and do that acquisition, but I give all the credit in the world to Dave Clark,\" Petersen said. \"There\\'s no one probably in the world who would be better at running that last-mile e-com fulfillment network. Personally, I don\\'t have any experience and I would\\'ve been pretty intimidated to try and go pull that off.\" The mixed messaging from the 43-year-old Flexport founder underscores the dysfunction surrounding the sudden firing of Clark, who previously spent 23 years at Amazon and built its mammoth logistics network on the way to becoming one of Jeff Bezos\\' top deputies. It\\'s also indicative of a bigger challenge facing Flexport, whose software is designed to simplify the process of transporting goods. The company was valued at $8 billion by private investors in early 2022, just as the economy was turning and the 10-year tech bull market was coming to an end. As a high-valued company backed by powerful VCs, Flexport has been trying to simultaneously operate in Silicon Valley startup growth mode while also restraining expenses to reflect the new economic realities and to cope with supply chain bottlenecks. This account is based on conversations with people close to Clark and Petersen. They requested anonymity to discuss confidential interactions. Their perspectives have been corroborated by internal documents and communications reviewed by CNBC. Petersen has publicly said Clark overspent, overhired and overpromised, something his allies echoed to CNBC. He burned through cash and kept Petersen in the dark about key financials and an ambitious expansion into providing end-to-end supply chain tools for small and medium-sized businesses. People close to Petersen pointed to a number of previously unreported incidents that eroded his confidence in Clark. But documents viewed by CNBC and sources close to Clark undermine those claims. They show that Clark, who arrived when the company was struggling to bill customers and track containers, worked closely with the board and Petersen to implement decisions that Flexport now suggests were ill-advised. Evidence to support Flexport\\'s claims of financial mismanagement is lacking, raising questions about whether that narrative was put forward to justify Clark\\'s exit. A Flexport spokesperson rejected that characterization. \"Ryan Petersen returned as CEO in order to restore Flexport\\'s culture of customer engagement, and drive the growth and cost discipline required to return the company to profitability,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\\n\\nGet IPO ready\\n\\nClark arrived last year as the perfect hire for a tech startup trying to disrupt the age-old logistics industry. He\\'d built Amazon\\'s logistics unit into a juggernaut that rivaled carriers like UPS and FedEx .\\n\\nRyan Petersen, chief executive officer of Flexport, participates in a panel discussion during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nSince 2021, Petersen had been seeking a successor for Flexport\\'s then-operating chief, Sanne Manders, in part to address what several ex-employees described as lingering issues with the company\\'s troubled billing processes. Fixing that was Clark\\'s job. Petersen and Clark worked together as co-CEOs for the first six months. In March, Petersen transitioned to executive chairman. The co-CEO arrangement would free Petersen up to do what he loved – \"getting beers with customers,\" in the words of two former Flexport employees. Clark, a self-described \"builder at heart,\" was at the wheel. Among Clark\\'s goals was to help Petersen prepare Flexport for an IPO, something the company had discussed doing within a two- to three-year window, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents viewed by CNBC. \"There\\'s a perfect complement of skill sets,\" Petersen told Forbes in June 2022. \"Mine are much more creative, zero-to-one founder time, and Dave is the supreme executor and a legend in the supply chain world.\" Buying Deliverr was meant to be the first step in turning Flexport into a more full-scale logistics service for its customers. Shopify had acquired Deliverr in May 2022 for $2.1 billion. But the e-commerce software company was getting hammered by Wall Street as its Covid pandemic pop faded. By January 2023, CEO Tobias Lutke knew he needed to get rid of Deliverr. Around that time, Lutke first approached Petersen to float the possibility of a deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Petersen told Clark he should engage with Shopify\\'s team, according to a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations. Initial talks fell apart, but resumed when Flexport executives learned that Shopify was about to execute deep cost cuts and was eager to sell Deliverr. Clark and Petersen flew to Miami to meet with Shopify\\'s leadership. As a transaction was nearing, Clark, who had a reputation as a deft negotiator, got Shopify, which was already an investor in Flexport, to sweeten it with $40 million in cash and the framework for a $260 million convertible note that could help Flexport on its path to an IPO, according to an internal document analyzing the deal. The sale would be announced alongside Shopify\\'s first-quarter earnings report on May 4. \"We did not change the terms of a deal or rush it just to have it line up with an earnings call,\" Shopify said in a statement. With Flexport, \"we are tightly mission-aligned to ensure the success of our merchants, which is why we chose to deepen our partnership with them earlier this year.\" The night before the announcement, Petersen appeared at a \"Tech Talk\" at Flexport\\'s Bellevue, Washington, office to pitch the \"Flexport vision\" to hundreds of people. An attendee asked Petersen whether Flexport would ever get into last-mile logistics. Petersen paused, glanced at his watch, and said to keep an eye on the morning news, according to a Flexport employee who witnessed the exchange and by a person who was told independently. The comment alarmed Clark and Flexport executives, who were concerned that Petersen had disclosed material nonpublic information about a publicly traded company, according to people familiar with the matter. Petersen didn\\'t respond to calls or messages from CNBC, and the company declined to make him available for an interview. A Flexport spokesperson didn\\'t respond to CNBC\\'s question about whether Petersen was aware of concerns about his statement at the event.\\n\\nThe \\'whistleblower\\'\\n\\nClark\\'s first quarterly board meeting as sole CEO was June 1. His second was Aug. 31, days before he was forced out. The board was made up largely of investors who were betting on the founder. It included Founders Fund\\'s Trae Stephens, who had helped start defense-tech firm Anduril Industries, and Michael Ronen, who left SoftBank in 2020. Andreessen Horowitz was represented by Bob Swan, an operating partner at the firm and former CEO of Intel .\\n\\nBob Swan, then-interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Intel Corp., reacts during the inauguration of the company\\'s research and development facility in Bengaluru, India, on November 15, 2018. Samyukta Lakshmi | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nFor much of the summer, Clark had pushed then-CFO Kenny Wagers and his financial planning and analysis team to realign Flexport\\'s year-end and 18-month forecasts, according to a person close to the situation. The reasons were obvious. At the beginning of 2022, it cost around $14,500 to move a single container across the Pacific. By late 2022, prices of ocean freight from Asia to the U.S. West Coast were down 90% from a year earlier, due largely to weakening global demand. Because Flexport makes money by charging fees for the transportation of goods, the company\\'s business was getting hammered. But Wagers and Stuart Leung, a Flexport finance executive and a close Petersen ally, were reluctant to pare back forecasts, frustrating Clark, who felt those projections were overly optimistic. Wagers and Leung did not respond to CNBC\\'s interview requests. Clark ultimately prevailed, but the revised forecasts distressed Petersen. Clark, Petersen and Wagers met in Texas in mid-August to fine-tune the forecasts. A source close to Petersen told CNBC that the meeting went poorly for Clark because a so-called whistleblower — identified as a senior finance executive — stepped forward shortly before it began and told Petersen that the numbers being presented were \"not real.\" The source referred to the senior finance executive as a whistleblower because of the information he disclosed to Petersen about Clark. Documents seen by CNBC and conversations with people with direct knowledge of the board meeting make it clear that there were no substantiated whistleblower actions or allegations of financial impropriety. Flexport\\'s spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"There was no whistleblower nor was there any financial misconduct. Any allegations to the contrary are completely false.\" On Sept. 15, shortly after CNBC spoke with the Petersen source, legal counsel for Clark sent a cease-and-desist letter to Flexport. The letter, viewed by CNBC, instructed the company to preserve and retain all communications involving Clark\\'s departure. The letter disputes the existence of a whistleblower and lists specific allegations as false and defamatory, including Petersen\\'s claims that Clark was an unfit CEO because he overextended the company\\'s lease obligations. Five hours after the letter was sent, the source close to Petersen contacted CNBC and asked to retract their statements and all details related to Clark\\'s firing or about the so-called whistleblower. CNBC declined to retract his statements. Petersen has since deleted several of his posts criticizing Clark.\\n\\nDave Clark, Amazon\\'s former senior vice president of worldwide operations. Lindsey Wasson | Reuters\\n\\nThe letter cited two documents that had been presented to the board. Both were viewed by CNBC. The first was a pre-acquisition financial analysis of the Deliverr deal, and the second was a review of Flexport\\'s first-quarter numbers. The Deliverr analysis was presented by the co-CEOs to the board for their approval and was shaped by multiple prior board meetings. Clark\\'s camp suggested that other factors may have led to the abrupt firing. For example, politics. Days after Clark was ousted, Petersen sent him a message — seen by CNBC — blasting one of his key female executives for wasting her days at the company on \"far left-wing political activism.\" The executive is a registered Republican. Stephens, the Founders Fund partner, also shared his contempt for that executive weeks before Clark\\'s departure, a person familiar with the board told CNBC. Stephens did not respond to CNBC\\'s request for comment. Petersen is also a venture partner at Founders Fund, the firm started by Peter Thiel, who was a prominent supporter of President Trump\\'s 2016 campaign and more recently bankrolled Senate candidates in Ohio and Arizona. Many of Thiel\\'s closest confidantes at Founders Fund and elsewhere in the venture industry are outspoken conservatives. Petersen\\'s sole public political contribution in 2023 was to a Democratic political action committee associated with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. He doesn\\'t talk much about politics on social media or in interviews. Clark has donated to candidates on both sides of the aisle. Upon his departure, The Wall Street Journal reported that he was considering running for governor of Texas, but two people familiar with his thinking say it\\'s not happening anytime soon. Flexport told CNBC that an employee\\'s politics are not relevant in personnel decisions. \"Ryan Petersen does not care at all about anyone\\'s political or personal affiliations. That is their business,\" the spokesperson said. \"It is inappropriate for any employee to spend an excessive amount of time during work hours on activities unrelated to their role.\" A person familiar with the female executive said her noncorporate endeavors were largely related to charitable organizations. Clark has largely remained silent since he was forced to resign on Sept. 5, though in private he\\'s expressed frustration at how his former team was being treated by Flexport, according to people close to him. Many of his allies at Amazon who joined him at Flexport were summarily fired by Petersen shortly after his departure. On Sept. 13, Flexport\\'s chief legal counsel, Chris Ferro, contacted Clark. Ferro told him that his resignation a week prior had not been accepted, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Instead, Ferro told Clark that Flexport\\'s board met the day after Clark resigned and voted to fire him for cause, the person familiar said. Ferro said the board minutes didn\\'t yet reflect why Clark had been fired, the person said. Ferro allegedly told Clark that Flexport would be willing to give him a block of 2 million shares — worth millions of dollars — if he signed a separation agreement that included nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses. Clark declined, the person said. Shortly after Flexport reached out with the offer, Clark took the stage at the same supply chain conference in Phoenix that Petersen spoke at earlier in the day. He didn\\'t hold back. \"The only thing I really regret from the past year was I sort of picked the wrong founder,\" Clark said. \"Basically, it was a place of extending my reputational halo to a group that, in my opinion, didn\\'t deserve it. Largely, because about half the team was let go last week on Friday, the most brutal nonseverance packages I\\'ve ever seen in my life. It was about as disrespectful a way as humanly possible.\"\\n\\nAmazon showdown\\n\\nOn top of the public relations fallout from the Clark saga and any legal wrangling that may follow, Flexport faces staffing turnover and a growing threat from Clark\\'s former employer. Flexport recently ousted Wagers as CFO and lost its human resources chief. More layoffs are expected soon, sources said, after the company cut 20% of its staff in January. On Sept. 12, almost a week after Clark was fired, Flexport executives convened in Seattle to launch an end-to-end supply chain service that would allow sellers to move their products from factories to customers\\' doorsteps through integrations with major online marketplaces. The project was spearheaded by Parisa Sadrzadeh, an executive vice president at Flexport who Clark had poached from Amazon\\'s logistics unit. Earlier in the day, and just up the street from Flexport\\'s event, Amazon had unveiled a strikingly similar service in front of approximately 2,200 attendees at its annual Accelerate seller conference. Flexport had planned to have a booth onsite but was told it couldn\\'t be an exhibitor, which some staffers suspected was due to the competing supply chain products, according to a person familiar with the matter. Flexport discussed securing exhibit space at Accelerate months earlier but didn\\'t meet all the requirements to participate, and its launch wasn\\'t mentioned in those conversations, Amazon said. Flexport\\'s event was underwhelming. In a conference room, about 50 people looked on as Sadrzadeh debuted Flexport\\'s service and then introduced Petersen, who spoke for roughly 20 minutes, according to Burak Yolga, co-founder of a digital freight forwarding company who was in attendance. \"Flexport announced pretty much the same thing that Amazon announced,\" Yolga said in an interview. He said he left after about a half-hour. The company paid rapper Nelly $150,000 to perform at the event. But in the days leading up to the launch, Petersen opted to squash the performance because the optics were bad after his post about rescinding job offers, a person familiar with the matter said. Despite canceling the event, Flexport still paid the artist. WATCH: Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen on reinvesting profits', 'Meta has a moderation bias problem, not just a ‘bug,’ that’s suppressing Palestinian voices Instagram users suspect Meta of shadowbanning content about Palestine. The platform has a history of inherent bias.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Palestinian-American filmmaker Khitam Jabr posted a handful of Reels about her family’s trip to the West Bank. In the short travel vlogs, Jabr shared snippets of Palestinian culture, from eating decadent meals to dancing at her niece’s wedding.\\n\\n“I hadn’t been in a decade, so it’s just like, life abroad,” Jabr told TechCrunch.\\n\\n“I would get [anti-Palestine] comments,” she recalled. “And I couldn’t respond [to them] or use my account for 24 hours. I wasn’t even posting anything about the occupation. But fast forward to now and the same shit’s happening.”\\n\\nIn the aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israelis, Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes and total blockade — cutting access to electricity, water and vital supplies — have devastated Gaza. In response to the escalating violence, Meta said that it is closely monitoring its platforms for violations and may inadvertently flag certain content, but it never intends to “suppress a particular community or point of view.” Content praising or supporting Hamas, which governs Gaza and is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, is expressly forbidden on Meta’s platforms.\\n\\nAs the humanitarian crisis in Gaza grows more dire, many social media users suspect Instagram of censoring content about the besieged Palestinian territory, even if that content doesn’t support Hamas. Users have also complained that they’ve been harassed and reported for posting content about Palestine, regardless of whether or not it violates Meta’s policies. Jabr, for example, suspects that Instagram restricted her for 24 hours because other users reported her Palestine travel videos. Most recently, Instagram users accused Meta of “shadowbanning” their Stories about Palestine.\\n\\nIt’s the latest in a lengthy history of incidents on Meta platforms that reflect an inherent bias against Palestinian users in its processes, as documented by years of complaints from both inside and outside the company. The company may not intentionally suppress specific communities, but its moderation practices often disproportionately affect Palestinian users.\\n\\nFor instance, Meta struggles to navigate the cultural and linguistic nuances of Arabic, a language with over 25 dialects, and has been criticized for neglecting to adequately diversify its language resources. The company’s black-and-white policies often preclude it from effectively moderating any nuanced topic, like content that discusses violence without condoning it. Advocacy groups have also raised concerns that Meta’s partnerships with government agencies, such as the Israeli Cyber Unit, politically influence the platform’s policy decisions.\\n\\nDuring the last violent outbreak between Hamas and Israel in 2021, a report commissioned by Meta and conducted by a third party concluded that the company’s actions had an “adverse human rights impact” on Palestinian users’ right to freedom of expression and political participation.\\n\\nMeta communications director Andy Stone declined to comment on the record, and pointed TechCrunch to Meta’s newsroom post about the conflict, which was updated on Oct. 18 with a statement addressing the shadowbanning claims.\\n\\n“Our policies are designed to keep people safe on our apps while giving everyone a voice,” the post stated. “We apply these policies equally around the world and there is no truth to the suggestion that we are deliberately suppressing voice … We can make errors and that is why there is an appeals process for people to tell us when they think we have made the wrong decision, so we can look into it.”\\n\\nThe belief that Meta shadowbans, or limits the visibility of, content about Palestine is not new. In an Instagram Story last year, supermodel and activist Bella Hadid, who is of Palestinian descent, alleged that Instagram “disabled” her from posting content on her Story “pretty much only when it is Palestine based.” She said she gets “immediately shadowbanned” when she posts about Palestine, and her Story views drop by “almost 1 million.”\\n\\nAs soon as Kehlani got super vocal and changed her profile picture to “i stand with Palestine” she got shadowbanned.\\n\\nJust as they did to Bella Hadid. The propaganda is insane.\\n\\nTHEY TRY TO SILENCE US. DON’T STOP!!\\n\\nFREE PALESTINE. 🇵🇸🇵🇸 pic.twitter.com/4lUvZsUbiA — Sabby Targaryen 🐉 (@whoisitbad) October 14, 2023\\n\\nMeta blamed technical errors for the removal of posts about Palestine during the 2021 conflict. When reached for comment about these recent claims of shadowbanning, a representative for the company pointed TechCrunch to a Threads post by Stone.\\n\\n“We identified a bug impacting all Stories that re-shared Reels and Feed posts, meaning they weren’t showing up properly in people’s Stories tray, leading to significantly reduced reach,” Stone said. “This bug affected accounts equally around the globe and had nothing to do with the subject matter of the content — and we fixed it as quickly as possible.”\\n\\nBut many are frustrated that Meta continues to disproportionately suppress Palestinian voices. Leen Al Saadi, a Palestinian journalist currently based in Jordan and host of the podcast “Preserving Palestine,” said she is used to “constantly being censored.” Her Instagram account was restricted last year after she posted a trailer for the podcast’s first episode, which discussed a documentary about Palestinian street art under occupation.\\n\\n“Palestinians are currently undergoing two wars,” Al Saadi said. “The first is with their legal occupier. The second war is with the entire Western media landscape, and when I say the entire landscape, I mean social media.”\\n\\nMeta’s alleged shadowbanning\\n\\nInstagram users accuse Meta of suppressing more than just Stories related to Palestine.\\n\\nCreators say engagement on their posts tanked specifically after they publicly condemned Israel’s response to the Hamas attack as excessively violent. Some, like Jabr, say they were restricted from posting or going live, while others say Instagram flagged their content as “sensitive,” limiting its reach. Users also allege their posts were flagged as “inappropriate” and removed, even if the content adhered to Instagram’s Community Guidelines.\\n\\nMeta’s representative didn’t address the other accusations of censorship beyond just Story visibility and did not respond to TechCrunch’s follow-up questions. When asked for comment, Stone directed TechCrunch to Meta’s updated newsroom post, which said Meta identified and fixed a “bug” that prevented users from going live.\\n\\n“This was also a global issue that was fixed within a few hours. We understand people rely on these tools and we’re sorry to anyone who felt the impact of these issues,” the post stated.\\n\\nIt’s unclear if this “bug” impacted accounts posting content unrelated to Gaza. Instagram users have posted screenshots showing that Stories about Palestine have received significantly fewer views than other Stories posted on the same day, and allege that their view counts went back up when they posted content unrelated to the conflict.\\n\\nofc IG’s hiding my stories about Palestine, y’all see the difference? lmaoaoaoao pic.twitter.com/1iYIIKBhtN — ༒︎ (@arxbprince) October 15, 2023\\n\\nA user based in Egypt, who asked to stay anonymous for fear of harassment, said her posts usually get around 300 views, but when she started posting pro-Palestine content after the Hamas attack earlier this month, her stories would only get one to two views.\\n\\n“It happened to all my friends, too,” she continued. “Then we noticed that posting a random pic would get higher views. So by posting a random pic, then a pro-Palestine post, would increase the views.”\\n\\nAnother Instagram user based in the United Kingdom, who also asked to stay anonymous out of fear of harassment, said that his view count returned to normal when he posted a cat photo.\\n\\n“My stories went from 100s of views to zero or a handful,” he said. “I’ve had to post intermittent non-Gaza content in order to ‘release’ my stories to be viewed again.”\\n\\nIt isn’t just Stories. The Arab Center for Social Media Advancement (7amleh), which documents cases of Palestinian digital rights violations and works directly with social media companies to appeal violations, told TechCrunch it has received reports of Instagram inconsistently filtering comments containing the Palestinian flag emoji. Users report that Instagram has flagged comments containing the emoji as “potentially offensive,” hiding the comment.\\n\\nMeta initially did not respond to follow-up requests for comment. When asked for comment, Stone pointed TechCrunch to Meta’s updated newsroom post, which did not directly address issues related to comments containing the Palestinian flag.\\n\\nThe organization has also received countless reports of Meta flagging and restricting Arabic content, even if it’s posted by news outlets. Jalal Abukhater, 7amleh’s advocacy manager, said that the organization has documented multiple cases of journalists on Instagram reporting the same news in Arabic, Hebrew and English, but only getting flagged for their Arabic content.\\n\\n“It’s literally journalistic content, but the same wording in Hebrew and English does not get restricted,” Abukhater said. “As if there’s better moderation for those languages, and more careless moderation for Arabic content.”\\n\\nStone declined to comment on allegations of Meta disproportionately flagging Arabic news content, instead directing TechCrunch to the updated newsroom post — which did not directly address the allegations.\\n\\nAnd as the Intercept reported, Instagram and Facebook are flagging images of the al-Ahli Hospital, claiming that the content violates Meta’s Community Guidelines on nudity or sexual activity.\\n\\nThe Community Guidelines are enforced inconsistently, particularly when it comes to content related to Palestine. Al Saadi recently tried to report a comment that said she should be “raped” and “burned alive” — left in response to her comment on a CNN post about the conflict — but in screenshots reviewed by TechCrunch, Instagram said that it didn’t violate the platform’s Community Guidelines against violence or dangerous organizations.\\n\\n“The restrictions on content, especially the content that relates to Palestine, is heavily politicized,” Abukhater said. “It feeds into the bias against Palestinian narrative genuinely. It really takes the balance against Palestinians in a situation where there’s a huge asymmetry of power.”\\n\\nA history of suppression\\n\\nContent about Palestine is disproportionately scrutinized, as demonstrated during the last severe violent outbreak between Hamas and Israel two years ago. Amid the violence following the May 2021 court ruling to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem, users across Facebook and Instagram accused Meta of taking down posts and suspending accounts that voiced support for Palestinians.\\n\\nThe digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) described Meta’s actions in 2021 as “systemic censorship of Palestinian voices.” In its 2022 report of Palestinian digital rights, 7amleh said that Meta is “still the most restricting company” compared to other social media giants in the extent of its moderation of the Palestinian digital space.\\n\\nMeta forbids support of terrorist organizations, like most social media companies based in the U.S., but struggles to moderate content around it, from user discourse to journalistic updates. This policy, along with the company’s partnership with Israel to monitor posts that incite violence, complicates things for Palestinians living under Hamas’ governance. As EFF points out, something as simple as Hamas’ flag in the background of an image can result in a strike.\\n\\nJillian York, the director for international freedom of expression for EFF, blames automation and decisions made by “minimally trained humans” for the inconsistency. Meta’s zero tolerance policy and imprecise enforcement often suppress content from or about conflict zones, she said. The site’s moderation issues have negatively affected multiple non-English speaking regions, including Libya, Syria and Ukraine.\\n\\n“These rules can prevent people from sharing documentation of human rights violations, documentation of war crimes, even just news about what’s happening on the ground,” York continued. “And so I think that is what is the most problematic right now about that particular rule, and the way that it’s enforced.”\\n\\nOver the 13 days leading up to the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, 7amleh documented more than 500 reports of Palestinian “digital rights violations,” including the removal and restriction of content, hashtags and accounts related to the conflict.\\n\\nMeta blamed some of the instances of perceived censorship to technical issues, like one that prevented users in Palestine and Colombia from posting Instagram Stories. It attributed others to human error, like blocking the hashtag for Al-Aqsa Mosque, the holy site where Israeli police clashed with Ramadan worshippers, because it was mistaken for a terrorist organization. The company also blocked journalists in Gaza from WhatsApp without explanation.\\n\\nThe same month, a group of Facebook employees filed internal complaints accusing the company of bias against Arab and Muslim users. In internal posts obtained by BuzzFeed News, an employee attributed the bias to “years and years of implementing policies that just don’t scale globally.”\\n\\nAt the recommendation of its Oversight Board, Meta conducted a third-party due diligence report about the platform’s moderation during the May 2021 conflict. The report found that Arabic content was flagged as potentially violating at significantly higher rates than Hebrew content was, and was more likely to be erroneously removed. The report noted that Meta’s moderation system may not be as precise for Arabic content as it was for Hebrew content, because the latter is a “more standardized language,” and suggested that reviewers may lack the linguistic and cultural competence to understand less common Arabic dialects like Palestinian Arabic.\\n\\nHas anything improved?\\n\\nMeta committed to implementing policy changes based on the report’s recommendations, such as updating its keywords associated with dangerous organizations, disclosing government requests to remove content and launching a hostile speech classifier for Hebrew content. Abukhater added that Meta has improved its response to harassment, at least in comparison to other social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Although harassment and abuse are still rampant on Instagram and Facebook, he said, the company has been responsive to suspending accounts with patterns of targeting other users.\\n\\nThe company has also made more contact with regional Palestinian organizations since 2021, York added, but it’s been slow to implement recommendations from EFF and other advocacy groups. It’s “very clear” that Meta is not putting the same resources behind Arabic and other non-English languages, York said, compared to the attention Meta gives to countries that have the most regulatory pressure. Moderation of English and other European languages tends to be more comprehensive, for example, because the EU enforces the Digital Services Act.\\n\\nIn Meta’s response to the report, Miranda Sissons, the company’s director of human rights, said that Meta was “assessing the feasibility” of reviewing Arabic content by dialect. Sissons said that the company has “large and diverse teams” who understand “local cultural context across the region,” including in Palestine. Responding to the escalating violence earlier this month, Meta stated that it established a “special operations center” staffed with fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers to closely monitor and respond to violating content.\\n\\nDespite Meta’s apparent efforts to diversify its language resources, Arabic is still disproportionately flagged as violating — like in the case of journalists reporting news in multiple languages.\\n\\n“The balance of power is very fixed, in reality, between Israelis and Palestinians,” Abukhater said. “And this is something that today is reflected heavily on platforms like Meta, even though they have human rights teams releasing reports and trying to improve upon their policies. Whenever an escalation like the one we’re experiencing now happens, things just go back to zero.”\\n\\nAnd at times, Meta’s Arabic translations are completely inaccurate. This week, multiple Instagram users raised concerns over the platform mistranslating the relatively common Arabic phrase “Alhamdulillah,” or “Praise be to God.” In screen recordings posted online, users found that if they included “Palestinian” and the corresponding flag emoji in their Instagram bio along with the Arabic phrase, Instagram automatically translated their bio to “Palestinian terrorists – Praise be to Allah” or “Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom.” When users removed “Palestinian” and the flag emoji, Instagram translated the Arabic phrase to “Thank God.” Instagram users complained that the offensive mistranslation was active for hours before Meta appeared to correct it.\\n\\nShayaan Khan, a TikTok creator who posted a viral video about the mistranslation, told TechCrunch that Meta’s lack of cultural competence isn’t just offensive, it’s dangerous. He said that the “glitch” can fuel Islamophobic and racist rhetoric, which has already been exacerbated by the war in Gaza. Khan pointed to the fatal stabbing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian-American child whose death is being investigated as a hate crime.\\n\\nMeta did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment about the mistranslation. Abukhater said that Meta told 7amleh that a “bug” caused the mistranslation. In a statement to 404 Media, a Meta spokesperson said that the issue had been fixed.\\n\\n“We fixed a problem that briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations in some of our products,” the statement said, “We sincerely apologize that this happened.”\\n\\nAs the war continues, social media users have tried to find ways around the alleged shadowbanning on Instagram. Supposed loopholes include misspelling certain words, like “p@lestine” instead of “Palestine,” in hopes of bypassing any content filters. Users also share information about Gaza in text superimposed over unrelated images, like a cat photo, so it won’t be flagged as graphic or violent content. Creators have tried to include an emoji of the Israeli flag or tag their posts and Stories with #istandwithisrael, even if they don’t support the Israeli government, in hopes of gaming engagement.\\n\\nAl Saadi said that her frustration with Meta is common among Palestinians, both in occupied territories and across the diaspora.\\n\\n“All we’re asking for is to give us the exact same rights,” she said. “We’re not asking for more. We’re literally just asking Meta, Instagram, every single broadcast channel, every single media outlet, to just give us the respect that we deserve.”\\n\\nDominic-Madori Davis contributed to this story’s reporting.', 'Welcome to Startups Weekly.

            "            Context: ['Earlier this year, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled that Apple had infringed on two patents from medical device maker Masimo. As a result, the ITC said it would impose an import ban on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 starting December 26th. At the time it was hard to believe that this would actually come to pass: Apple gets sued all the time, and even when it loses, how often does it actually face dramatic consequences?\\n\\nWell, now would be one of those times. Experts say that, barring a Christmas miracle, it’s unlikely that Apple will find a way to escape the ban. Case in point, the company shocked everyone yesterday when it decided to preemptively pull the watches from its online store starting December 21st at 3PM ET. And after the 24th, they’ll disappear from Apple Stores, too.\\n\\n“I think Apple sees the writing on the wall and they’re preparing themselves,” says Ben Levi, a partner at Levi Snotherly & Schaumberg, which has experience litigating ITC disputes.\\n\\nIt’s rare to see Big Tech lose — and with such tangible consequences at that. There are still ways that Apple can keep the watches on sale, but it’ll likely take a lot of waiting or a lot of money to make it happen.\\n\\nHow Apple got here\\n\\nThis ban is the result of a long-standing patent dispute between Apple and the medical device maker Masimo. The latter is known for its pulse oximetry tech, generally referred to as SpO2 or blood oxygen saturation in the wearable world, and it claims that Apple is using that patented technology without permission.\\n\\nThis particular story started about 10 years ago when Apple reached out to Masimo about a potential partnership around blood oxygen features on its wearables. Soon after, Apple reportedly poached several Masimo engineers and its chief medical officer. And then in fall 2020, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 6 — its first Apple Watch to feature an SpO2 sensor to measure blood oxygen saturation levels.\\n\\nThe SpO2 sensors measure blood oxygen levels and are at the heart of this patent dispute. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\\n\\nIn 2020, Masimo filed a lawsuit in the US District Court in the Central District of California accusing Apple of stealing trade secrets and infringing on 10 of its patents. That case dragged on and on, so Masimo then filed a separate case with the ITC in 2021. Then last year, Apple sued Masimo back, claiming the company made an Apple Watch clone with its Masimo W1 Medical Watch. Clearly, there’s some bad blood here. But in this case, the important thing is that the ITC sided with Masimo. In January 2023, it ruled that Apple Watches did in fact infringe on Masimo patents.\\n\\nThe ITC then issued an import ban in October, as well as an order to stop selling products infringing on Masimo’s patents that had already been imported. We’re currently nearing the end of a 60-day presidential review period, in which President Joe Biden or the US Trade Representative (USTR) has the opportunity to veto the ban. If there’s no veto by the time the review period ends, the ban will go into effect.\\n\\nBut will Biden actually veto?\\n\\nApple getting a presidential veto would be like lightning striking the same place twice.\\n\\n“It is extraordinarily rare for the President to overturn a decision from the International Trade Commission and in my view, [it’s] unlikely in this particular case,” says Andrei Iancu, co-chair of the Council for Innovation Promotion (C4IP) and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, who was also the director of the US Patent and Trademark Office from 2018 to 2021.\\n\\nTo get a veto, a company usually has to show a public interest or health policy basis — and that isn’t the case here. “It’s unlikely that the import exclusion order will be disapproved by the USTR and the president,” says Smith Brittingham, partner at Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, LLP. “The only real answer would be, ‘Well, it’s Apple.’”\\n\\nThat said, Apple did manage to beat the system once. In 2013, then President Barack Obama vetoed an import ban on the iPhone. At the time, Samsung accused Apple of infringing on its cellular data patents. But in that case, according to Levi, Apple was able to make the argument that there were issues regarding fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory licensing (FRAND). The patents involved were considered standard and essential, and the Obama administration was concerned the import ban would give Samsung “undue leverage.” Plus, it only impacted the iPhone 4 and older models of the iPad. Newer iPhones didn’t use an infringing chipset. In the case of the Apple Watch, Apple doesn’t have any of these arguments.\\n\\n“In that case 10 years ago, Apple really rolled the dice and the pulled the rabbit out of the hat. It’s very unlikely for them to do that again,” says Levi.\\n\\nWhere does Apple go from here?\\n\\nA hail mary veto is unlikely, but that doesn’t mean Apple is just going to accept an import ban on a $17 billion segment of its business. Apple spokesperson Nikki Rothberg told The Verge in a statement that the company was “pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers.” That means the watch is going back on sale one way or another — it’s just a question of what path Apple takes.\\n\\nApple has already indicated that it plans to appeal, but appealing is a lengthy process that can take around 18 months. The company will also probably ask for a stay on the import ban, but Brittingham says that’s not likely to be granted because Apple would have to prove that it would be irreparably harmed. In other words, it’d have to make a convincing case that it would go out of business if it can’t sell the Apple Watch.\\n\\nApple says it’s exploring both legal and technical options to get around this import ban. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\\n\\nWhile the Apple Watch is a popular product and makes up for roughly 30 percent of the smartwatch market, Apple won’t go under if the Apple Watch is out of commission in just the US. It’ll hurt to lose such an important market, but it can still sell all three of its Apple Watch models abroad. Similarly, the import ban wouldn’t affect every Apple Watch. The entry-level SE is unaffected by the ban as it doesn’t have blood oxygen sensing capabilities.\\n\\nThe SE points to one way for Apple to sidestep the import ban altogether. According to both Brittingham and Levi, Apple could redesign its Apple Watch to avoid the infringed patents until the appeals process is done. Theoretically, all Apple has to do is push out a firmware update that disables the SpO2 sensor and then it could go right back to importing Apple Watches for sale.\\n\\nAnd there are indications that Apple is actively pursuing that option. Bloomberg reports that Apple engineers are scrambling to alter the blood oxygen algorithms on the watches. The report quotes an unnamed Apple spokesperson saying the company plans to submit a workaround to the US customs agency to get the product back on shelves.\\n\\nDo Apple’s SpO2 sensors even matter? Speaking as a wearables reviewer, removing the SpO2 sensors wouldn’t be the end of the world for Apple in the short term. Apple’s blood oxygen features are mostly for wellness and sleep tracking — and they’re not that useful beyond determining your nightly baseline. I’m willing to bet the average Apple Watch user forgets that the blood oxygen features even exist. In the case of the Apple Watch, it periodically takes SpO2 readings in the background, or you can actively take a spot check. However, Apple itself doesn’t really make wide use of these metrics. It’s not like how the watch uses its EKG capabilities to detect atrial fibrillation. On consumer wearables, SpO2 features generally have no medical use cases. They’re essentially for “entertainment” purposes, and we’ve repeatedly reported that you should never, ever use them as any sort of replacement for traditional pulse oximeters. The only real blow for Apple is if the rumors are correct and it’s working on sleep apnea detection. Losing the sensors in that instance would make developing this feature harder. However, that feature would require a lengthy FDA clearance process. That means more advanced health features like sleep apnea detection are more of a medium to long-term concern — and it’s very possible that Apple will have a workaround by the time such features are ready for consumers.\\n\\nThat said, for this route to be successful, Iancu says it depends on the specific patent, ITC ruling, and what exactly Apple has planned as far as redesigning the product.\\n\\n“From a legal perspective, whatever change Apple makes has to be significant enough to avoid the patent, and it cannot be what’s called a ‘colorable’ difference. Minor changes will not be sufficient,” Iancu says.\\n\\nBasically, Apple can’t simply make a small tweak to the code and call it a day. Masimo claims that the patents are hardware related, so even completely disabling the sensor may not work depending on how the patent is written. Apple could remove it entirely from the design, but that would require mucking around with Apple’s meticulous supply chain and could take some time.\\n\\nThen there are the options that would cost Apple some money. Apple could sit down with Masimo and hammer out a licensing deal for the infringed patents. In a New York Times interview, Masimo CEO Joe Kiani said Apple “had not engaged in licensing negotiations.” It’s an easy-seeming fix, so why not do it? For starters, both parties have to want to settle.\\n\\n“Apple is a tough nut to crack,” says Brittingham, noting that Apple is one of the most sued companies in Silicon Valley. The company’s large cash reserves also make taking Apple to court a costly endeavor. Masimo, for example, has reportedly spent $60 million litigating the issue thus far. “I think they tend to hold out as long as possible in order to make it less appetizing to sue Apple.”\\n\\nThe other option is for Apple to avoid the import ban altogether. Iancu says Apple could simply decide to manufacture the watches within the US instead of overseas — but that’s a significant supply chain change that’s unlikely to happen any time soon.\\n\\nDoes this set a precedent?\\n\\nThis import ban isn’t the only one Apple is facing. In February, the Biden administration also declined to veto another ITC import ban and cease-and-desist order stemming from a dispute with AliveCor over the Apple Watch’s EKG features. Like Masimo, AliveCor argued that Apple stole its tech to develop the wearable EKG feature, thereby infringing on its patents. However, while the two cases look similar, the result of one doesn’t speak to how the other will play out.\\n\\n“Every case is different, every patent is different,” says Levi. “Different complainants who bring up a case have got their own businesses, their own products, and those implicate a whole different set of facts.”\\n\\nThe Apple Watch SE will remain unaffected because it doesn’t have a blood oxygen sensor. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\\n\\nCase in point, while the ITC granted AliveCor’s import ban, it hasn’t had any impact because the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled that AliveCor’s EKG tech isn’t actually patentable. AliveCor would have to win its appeal to that ruling before any Apple Watches with EKG features would be pulled from the market for that reason.\\n\\nEven so, Iancu says everything is working as it ought to. “The takeaway is that the system is working as originally intended. If Apple wants to have products imported into the US, it should make sure that it comes up with its original inventions and does not infringe on other people’s patented technology.”\\n\\nUltimately, if this import ban goes through — which it’s looking a lot like it will — that doesn’t mean you’ll never be able to buy another Apple Watch in the US. As mentioned, the SE remains completely unaffected. In the short term, the ban also doesn’t forbid third-party resellers from selling their inventory of Series 9 or Ultra 2. Once they run out, only then it may pose a problem if they can’t buy more units from Apple.', 'Scalable Capital, a Munich startup that aims to make investing in financial markets accessible to a wider range of consumers, is putting more fuel in its tank to drive deeper into Europe. The company has raised €60 million in equity ($65 million at today’s rates). It will be using the funds to build out its business in the six countries — Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Spain and Netherlands — where it is already active and to expand into more. Balderton is leading the round, with participation from HV Capital out of its new growth fund and other unnamed existing backers.\\n\\nContrary to the startup’s name, this round is coming in at a flat valuation of $1.4 billion. This was the same valuation Scalable Capital had the last time it raised money — $180 million in 2021, a round led by Tencent, with BlackRock, HV and Tengelmann participating. That is despite the fact that the startup is now “four or five times bigger” than it was two years ago, according to co-CEO Erik Podzuweit, who co-founded the company with Florian Prucker.\\n\\nToday, Scalable Capital, which started as a digital wealth management platform, now describes itself as a full-service brokerage. It has 1.2 million savings plans on the platform, which it tells me works out to over 600,000 customers, and close to €17 billion under management, with products covering ETFs, stocks, funds, bonds, cryptocurrencies and derivatives, and loans. It gives users access to investing in 8,000 stocks, 2,500 ETFs and 3,500 funds among other products; ETFs are the most popular today.\\n\\nThat speaks a lot to the ongoing pressure on startups amid a very tight market for finance at the moment in the region. (More on that theme in the latest annual, barometric report from Atomico.)\\n\\n“Yes, we are four or five times bigger than we were at the last round,” Podzuweit said in an interview. “So like for like, obviously it’s a very attractive deal for the investor. But in the current market environment, I think it’s really cool that we managed to get to pull this off.” He confirmed that the company still has “the majority of the money from the last funding round” in the bank, but this extra injection means it can be a little more aggressive in its approach. “We can do a bit more marketing, we can hire the top people but we also have a much bigger equity cushion,” he said. The company has now raised more than $345 million, it said.\\n\\nIndeed, the fundraise may be coming at a tight time for startup finance, but one likely reason that Scalable took the money now is that, for neobrokers, the landscape is getting more competitive and crowded.\\n\\nLate last month, Robinhood — the tech company best known for democratizing investing in the U.S. — finally took its first step into international (and European) territories, opening an office in the U.K. (and just today launching crypto trading in the EU on the back of that). Other players out of the U.K. market with clear European ambitions include Freetrade and Lightyear.\\n\\nAnd just yesterday, Scalable Capital’s biggest rival among startups, Trade Republic, secured a full banking license from the European Central Bank. The latter, backed by Sequoia among others and last valued at $5.3 billion back in June 2022 (via PitchBook), said it will use the new license to launch more savings and investment products — a move that will lay the gauntlet down for Scalable to figure out if, and how, it will level up.\\n\\nFor now, Scalable Capital is holding steady and not pursuing a license itself, said Podzuweit.\\n\\n“It’s leaner, obviously,” he said, likening it to how some e-commerce companies might invest in building out their own logistics, and some work with third parties (Scalable’s banking partners, in lieu of a license, include ING). “Maybe I wouldn’t rule [getting a license] out forever. But right now we’re focusing on building products and launching new markets and we are faster doing it our way.”\\n\\nThe other big forces that are playing in the market include the looming presence of AI and how it will be used both to manage investing platforms, but also investments themselves; and the general state of the economy: Generally, markets have been in the doldrums, with inflation, and unfavorable interest rates bringing a chilling effect to consumers’ inclination to take risks and invest money that could be used more immediately elsewhere.\\n\\nScalable’s positioning, as it is with others like it, is that it leaves the door open for smaller and more incremental buy-ins from its customers. On top of this, Podzuweit points out that the startup’s average user age is 35, a person perhaps with more disposable income than some of the younger consumers that other neobrokers have courted.\\n\\nThe focus on ramping up at a time when the market looks like it has cooled is also very much in line with the ethos of investing, where people often put down their money at lower points if they believe that it will represent a great deal in the longer run. Of course, only time will tell whether that firm belief in growth longer term will play out as hoped.\\n\\nBalderton general partner Rana Yared is joining the board with this round. “Scalable’s one-stop, digital-first, wealth building and generating platform brings a suite of top-class financial products to individuals across Europe, and is unparalleled in the market,” she said in a statement. “We’ve been impressed by Erik, Florian and team’s vision and execution to date and are delighted to be supporting them in this next chapter.” We’re hopefully hearing from Yared directly later today and will update this more after that.\\n\\nUpdated to correct the amount raised in 2021 to $180 million, not $140 million; and to specify the number of customers and the total raised, after the numbers were provided by the company post-publication.', 'In this article SHOP-CA\\n\\nUPS\\n\\nFDX\\n\\nAMZN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\n\\nDave Clark (L) and Ryan Petersen (R) Getty Images\\n\\nOn Sept. 13, Flexport founder Ryan Petersen took the stage at North America\\'s premier supply chain conference in Phoenix. It was exactly a week after he\\'d forced out his hand-picked successor as CEO, ex-Amazon executive Dave Clark, so Petersen could once again run the show. Sitting in the first few rows of attendees was Clark, the man he\\'d ousted just a year into the job. Petersen was surprised that he showed up, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Days earlier, Petersen had excoriated Clark, alleging he\\'d secretly expanded the company\\'s headcount and taken on unnecessary leases without Petersen or the board\\'s knowledge. On X, formerly known as Twitter, Petersen wrote, \"Strategic Plan, Day 1: Make better decisions!\" With Clark sitting a few feet away, Petersen struck a different tone. \"I think we\\'re going to look back and go, \\'Wow I\\'d probably do that all over again because of the progress that we\\'ve made,\\'\" Petersen said, in an interview on stage. Doing it over again would seem to suggest hiring Clark wasn\\'t a bad decision. Petersen went even further, personally commending Clark for orchestrating the $1.3 billion purchase of Deliverr from Shopify , picking up supply chain technology for last-mile deliveries. That deal was announced in May. \"I\\'m very, very lucky because I wouldn\\'t have had the courage to go and do that acquisition, but I give all the credit in the world to Dave Clark,\" Petersen said. \"There\\'s no one probably in the world who would be better at running that last-mile e-com fulfillment network. Personally, I don\\'t have any experience and I would\\'ve been pretty intimidated to try and go pull that off.\" The mixed messaging from the 43-year-old Flexport founder underscores the dysfunction surrounding the sudden firing of Clark, who previously spent 23 years at Amazon and built its mammoth logistics network on the way to becoming one of Jeff Bezos\\' top deputies. It\\'s also indicative of a bigger challenge facing Flexport, whose software is designed to simplify the process of transporting goods. The company was valued at $8 billion by private investors in early 2022, just as the economy was turning and the 10-year tech bull market was coming to an end. As a high-valued company backed by powerful VCs, Flexport has been trying to simultaneously operate in Silicon Valley startup growth mode while also restraining expenses to reflect the new economic realities and to cope with supply chain bottlenecks. This account is based on conversations with people close to Clark and Petersen. They requested anonymity to discuss confidential interactions. Their perspectives have been corroborated by internal documents and communications reviewed by CNBC. Petersen has publicly said Clark overspent, overhired and overpromised, something his allies echoed to CNBC. He burned through cash and kept Petersen in the dark about key financials and an ambitious expansion into providing end-to-end supply chain tools for small and medium-sized businesses. People close to Petersen pointed to a number of previously unreported incidents that eroded his confidence in Clark. But documents viewed by CNBC and sources close to Clark undermine those claims. They show that Clark, who arrived when the company was struggling to bill customers and track containers, worked closely with the board and Petersen to implement decisions that Flexport now suggests were ill-advised. Evidence to support Flexport\\'s claims of financial mismanagement is lacking, raising questions about whether that narrative was put forward to justify Clark\\'s exit. A Flexport spokesperson rejected that characterization. \"Ryan Petersen returned as CEO in order to restore Flexport\\'s culture of customer engagement, and drive the growth and cost discipline required to return the company to profitability,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\\n\\nGet IPO ready\\n\\nClark arrived last year as the perfect hire for a tech startup trying to disrupt the age-old logistics industry. He\\'d built Amazon\\'s logistics unit into a juggernaut that rivaled carriers like UPS and FedEx .\\n\\nRyan Petersen, chief executive officer of Flexport, participates in a panel discussion during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nSince 2021, Petersen had been seeking a successor for Flexport\\'s then-operating chief, Sanne Manders, in part to address what several ex-employees described as lingering issues with the company\\'s troubled billing processes. Fixing that was Clark\\'s job. Petersen and Clark worked together as co-CEOs for the first six months. In March, Petersen transitioned to executive chairman. The co-CEO arrangement would free Petersen up to do what he loved – \"getting beers with customers,\" in the words of two former Flexport employees. Clark, a self-described \"builder at heart,\" was at the wheel. Among Clark\\'s goals was to help Petersen prepare Flexport for an IPO, something the company had discussed doing within a two- to three-year window, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents viewed by CNBC. \"There\\'s a perfect complement of skill sets,\" Petersen told Forbes in June 2022. \"Mine are much more creative, zero-to-one founder time, and Dave is the supreme executor and a legend in the supply chain world.\" Buying Deliverr was meant to be the first step in turning Flexport into a more full-scale logistics service for its customers. Shopify had acquired Deliverr in May 2022 for $2.1 billion. But the e-commerce software company was getting hammered by Wall Street as its Covid pandemic pop faded. By January 2023, CEO Tobias Lutke knew he needed to get rid of Deliverr. Around that time, Lutke first approached Petersen to float the possibility of a deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Petersen told Clark he should engage with Shopify\\'s team, according to a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations. Initial talks fell apart, but resumed when Flexport executives learned that Shopify was about to execute deep cost cuts and was eager to sell Deliverr. Clark and Petersen flew to Miami to meet with Shopify\\'s leadership. As a transaction was nearing, Clark, who had a reputation as a deft negotiator, got Shopify, which was already an investor in Flexport, to sweeten it with $40 million in cash and the framework for a $260 million convertible note that could help Flexport on its path to an IPO, according to an internal document analyzing the deal. The sale would be announced alongside Shopify\\'s first-quarter earnings report on May 4. \"We did not change the terms of a deal or rush it just to have it line up with an earnings call,\" Shopify said in a statement. With Flexport, \"we are tightly mission-aligned to ensure the success of our merchants, which is why we chose to deepen our partnership with them earlier this year.\" The night before the announcement, Petersen appeared at a \"Tech Talk\" at Flexport\\'s Bellevue, Washington, office to pitch the \"Flexport vision\" to hundreds of people. An attendee asked Petersen whether Flexport would ever get into last-mile logistics. Petersen paused, glanced at his watch, and said to keep an eye on the morning news, according to a Flexport employee who witnessed the exchange and by a person who was told independently. The comment alarmed Clark and Flexport executives, who were concerned that Petersen had disclosed material nonpublic information about a publicly traded company, according to people familiar with the matter. Petersen didn\\'t respond to calls or messages from CNBC, and the company declined to make him available for an interview. A Flexport spokesperson didn\\'t respond to CNBC\\'s question about whether Petersen was aware of concerns about his statement at the event.\\n\\nThe \\'whistleblower\\'\\n\\nClark\\'s first quarterly board meeting as sole CEO was June 1. His second was Aug. 31, days before he was forced out. The board was made up largely of investors who were betting on the founder. It included Founders Fund\\'s Trae Stephens, who had helped start defense-tech firm Anduril Industries, and Michael Ronen, who left SoftBank in 2020. Andreessen Horowitz was represented by Bob Swan, an operating partner at the firm and former CEO of Intel .\\n\\nBob Swan, then-interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Intel Corp., reacts during the inauguration of the company\\'s research and development facility in Bengaluru, India, on November 15, 2018. Samyukta Lakshmi | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nFor much of the summer, Clark had pushed then-CFO Kenny Wagers and his financial planning and analysis team to realign Flexport\\'s year-end and 18-month forecasts, according to a person close to the situation. The reasons were obvious. At the beginning of 2022, it cost around $14,500 to move a single container across the Pacific. By late 2022, prices of ocean freight from Asia to the U.S. West Coast were down 90% from a year earlier, due largely to weakening global demand. Because Flexport makes money by charging fees for the transportation of goods, the company\\'s business was getting hammered. But Wagers and Stuart Leung, a Flexport finance executive and a close Petersen ally, were reluctant to pare back forecasts, frustrating Clark, who felt those projections were overly optimistic. Wagers and Leung did not respond to CNBC\\'s interview requests. Clark ultimately prevailed, but the revised forecasts distressed Petersen. Clark, Petersen and Wagers met in Texas in mid-August to fine-tune the forecasts. A source close to Petersen told CNBC that the meeting went poorly for Clark because a so-called whistleblower — identified as a senior finance executive — stepped forward shortly before it began and told Petersen that the numbers being presented were \"not real.\" The source referred to the senior finance executive as a whistleblower because of the information he disclosed to Petersen about Clark. Documents seen by CNBC and conversations with people with direct knowledge of the board meeting make it clear that there were no substantiated whistleblower actions or allegations of financial impropriety. Flexport\\'s spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"There was no whistleblower nor was there any financial misconduct. Any allegations to the contrary are completely false.\" On Sept. 15, shortly after CNBC spoke with the Petersen source, legal counsel for Clark sent a cease-and-desist letter to Flexport. The letter, viewed by CNBC, instructed the company to preserve and retain all communications involving Clark\\'s departure. The letter disputes the existence of a whistleblower and lists specific allegations as false and defamatory, including Petersen\\'s claims that Clark was an unfit CEO because he overextended the company\\'s lease obligations. Five hours after the letter was sent, the source close to Petersen contacted CNBC and asked to retract their statements and all details related to Clark\\'s firing or about the so-called whistleblower. CNBC declined to retract his statements. Petersen has since deleted several of his posts criticizing Clark.\\n\\nDave Clark, Amazon\\'s former senior vice president of worldwide operations. Lindsey Wasson | Reuters\\n\\nThe letter cited two documents that had been presented to the board. Both were viewed by CNBC. The first was a pre-acquisition financial analysis of the Deliverr deal, and the second was a review of Flexport\\'s first-quarter numbers. The Deliverr analysis was presented by the co-CEOs to the board for their approval and was shaped by multiple prior board meetings. Clark\\'s camp suggested that other factors may have led to the abrupt firing. For example, politics. Days after Clark was ousted, Petersen sent him a message — seen by CNBC — blasting one of his key female executives for wasting her days at the company on \"far left-wing political activism.\" The executive is a registered Republican. Stephens, the Founders Fund partner, also shared his contempt for that executive weeks before Clark\\'s departure, a person familiar with the board told CNBC. Stephens did not respond to CNBC\\'s request for comment. Petersen is also a venture partner at Founders Fund, the firm started by Peter Thiel, who was a prominent supporter of President Trump\\'s 2016 campaign and more recently bankrolled Senate candidates in Ohio and Arizona. Many of Thiel\\'s closest confidantes at Founders Fund and elsewhere in the venture industry are outspoken conservatives. Petersen\\'s sole public political contribution in 2023 was to a Democratic political action committee associated with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. He doesn\\'t talk much about politics on social media or in interviews. Clark has donated to candidates on both sides of the aisle. Upon his departure, The Wall Street Journal reported that he was considering running for governor of Texas, but two people familiar with his thinking say it\\'s not happening anytime soon. Flexport told CNBC that an employee\\'s politics are not relevant in personnel decisions. \"Ryan Petersen does not care at all about anyone\\'s political or personal affiliations. That is their business,\" the spokesperson said. \"It is inappropriate for any employee to spend an excessive amount of time during work hours on activities unrelated to their role.\" A person familiar with the female executive said her noncorporate endeavors were largely related to charitable organizations. Clark has largely remained silent since he was forced to resign on Sept. 5, though in private he\\'s expressed frustration at how his former team was being treated by Flexport, according to people close to him. Many of his allies at Amazon who joined him at Flexport were summarily fired by Petersen shortly after his departure. On Sept. 13, Flexport\\'s chief legal counsel, Chris Ferro, contacted Clark. Ferro told him that his resignation a week prior had not been accepted, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Instead, Ferro told Clark that Flexport\\'s board met the day after Clark resigned and voted to fire him for cause, the person familiar said. Ferro said the board minutes didn\\'t yet reflect why Clark had been fired, the person said. Ferro allegedly told Clark that Flexport would be willing to give him a block of 2 million shares — worth millions of dollars — if he signed a separation agreement that included nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses. Clark declined, the person said. Shortly after Flexport reached out with the offer, Clark took the stage at the same supply chain conference in Phoenix that Petersen spoke at earlier in the day. He didn\\'t hold back. \"The only thing I really regret from the past year was I sort of picked the wrong founder,\" Clark said. \"Basically, it was a place of extending my reputational halo to a group that, in my opinion, didn\\'t deserve it. Largely, because about half the team was let go last week on Friday, the most brutal nonseverance packages I\\'ve ever seen in my life. It was about as disrespectful a way as humanly possible.\"\\n\\nAmazon showdown\\n\\nOn top of the public relations fallout from the Clark saga and any legal wrangling that may follow, Flexport faces staffing turnover and a growing threat from Clark\\'s former employer. Flexport recently ousted Wagers as CFO and lost its human resources chief. More layoffs are expected soon, sources said, after the company cut 20% of its staff in January. On Sept. 12, almost a week after Clark was fired, Flexport executives convened in Seattle to launch an end-to-end supply chain service that would allow sellers to move their products from factories to customers\\' doorsteps through integrations with major online marketplaces. The project was spearheaded by Parisa Sadrzadeh, an executive vice president at Flexport who Clark had poached from Amazon\\'s logistics unit. Earlier in the day, and just up the street from Flexport\\'s event, Amazon had unveiled a strikingly similar service in front of approximately 2,200 attendees at its annual Accelerate seller conference. Flexport had planned to have a booth onsite but was told it couldn\\'t be an exhibitor, which some staffers suspected was due to the competing supply chain products, according to a person familiar with the matter. Flexport discussed securing exhibit space at Accelerate months earlier but didn\\'t meet all the requirements to participate, and its launch wasn\\'t mentioned in those conversations, Amazon said. Flexport\\'s event was underwhelming. In a conference room, about 50 people looked on as Sadrzadeh debuted Flexport\\'s service and then introduced Petersen, who spoke for roughly 20 minutes, according to Burak Yolga, co-founder of a digital freight forwarding company who was in attendance. \"Flexport announced pretty much the same thing that Amazon announced,\" Yolga said in an interview. He said he left after about a half-hour. The company paid rapper Nelly $150,000 to perform at the event. But in the days leading up to the launch, Petersen opted to squash the performance because the optics were bad after his post about rescinding job offers, a person familiar with the matter said. Despite canceling the event, Flexport still paid the artist. WATCH: Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen on reinvesting profits']\n",

This scene is portrayed to be a tender and emotional exchange where Diana shares personal and honest thoughts with her sons, assuring them of her well-being and her intention to return home. This aligns with the publication's portrayal of Diana's emotional state during that time.\n",

            "On the other hand, the article from 'The Independent' mentioned in the context suggests that Prince William's emotional state following Princess Diana's death was one of \"intense grief and anger at his family's response.\" This indicates that 'The Independent' portrays William's state more negatively, with a focus on his struggle and the perceived insensitivity of the royal family.\n",

The latest installment takes place between the late 1990s to mid-2000s, and includes the lead-up to Princess Diana’s fatal Paris car crash in 1997.\\n\\nThe season begins with Princess Diana (played by Elizabeth Debicki) whisking her sons - Prince William (played by Rufus Kampa) and Prince Harry (played by Fflyn Edwards) - away on summer holiday to Saint-Tropez, France. After staying several days on Mohamed Al Fayed’s yacht, the boys return home to London where their father, the then-Prince of Wales, accompanies them to Balmoral Castle to vacation with the rest of the royal family in Scotland.\\n\\nIn episode three, Diana’s partner Dodi Fayed (played by Khalid Abdalla) surprises her with a quick trip to Paris, France. However, the princess is keen to return home to the United Kingdom, and is eager to speak to her sons over the phone. A mob of paparazzi following the couple delays Diana’s scheduled phone call with William and Harry, until she’s able to catch them again later that evening.\\n\\nIt is in this scene that The Crown depicts the doting mother’s final conversation with her sons.\\n\\nWilliam, then 15, and Harry, then 12, inquire over the phone when their mother will be coming back home from Paris. “I’m coming home tomorrow, and I’m seeing you both tomorrow night,” Diana replies in the episode, which also takes place on the same day as her fatal car crash later that evening. The boys then ask Diana whether she plans on marrying Dodi, considering their relationship has been plastered all over the tabloids.\\n\\nDiana’s poignant last words to William and Harry shown in The Crown scene\\n\\n“Well, you know better than to believe the papers,” she tells William, before adding: “I’m emphatically not going to marry Dodi. To be honest, I can’t wait to come home.”\\n\\nWhen William sweetly asks his mother if she’s doing “okay”, Diana candidly tells her eldest son: “I’m okay. It’s just a bit mad here. I don’t really understand how I ended up here. Mummy just needs to make some changes to her life, that’s all. But that’s not your problem, that’s mine.”\\n\\nBefore saying their goodbyes, Diana reminds William and Harry that she will be seeing them the next day - although that day never comes. “I’ll see you both tomorrow night,” she says. “Just the three of us.”\\n\\nThe moment unsurprisingly tugged on the heartstrings of many viewers, who took to social media to share their thoughts on the devastating moment.\\n\\n“The last phone call between Harry, William and Diana broke my heart,” one fan wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\\n\\n“That precious phone call between Diana and her sons,” said someone else. “Don’t mind me, I’m just gonna cry in one corner.”\\n\\n“The last call between Harry, William and Diana is heartbreaking,” a third user commented.\\n\\nIn both the series and in real-life, Diana and Dodi - along with their chauffeur, Henri Paul - were killed on 31 August 1997 when their Mercedes-Benz was pursued by paparazzi and crashed in the Pont de l’Alma tunnel in Paris. The mother of two was 36 years old.\\n\\nThe fatal car crash was recreated in the very first scene of season six. While the incident is not shown on-screen, a car carrying Diana and Dodi is seen speeding past a man walking his dog, before entering the tunnel. As the vehicle’s horn blares, he calls emergency services on his cell phone.\\n\\nAustralian actor Elizabeth Debicki, who took over the role of Diana from Emma Corrin in season five, admitted it was “difficult to recreate” the scene - especially with her character being hounded by the paparazzi. “It was heavy and very manic, and incredibly invasive. And it had a kind of pressure to it,” Debicki said in an interview with Netflix.\\n\\n“At times it’s almost like an animalistic response to being pursued, by that many actors playing the press, because there’s nowhere you can go and you only have to be in a situation like that for about a minute, before you realise this is completely unbearable.”\\n\\nThe first four episodes of The Crown season six are available to stream on Netflix in the US and UK.', 'Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviews Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

When season five arrived last year, there were calls for the show to include a “fictional explainer” – something Netflix did not do.\\n\\nWith the show heading into the late Nineties and early Noughties in its final season, which arrived on Netflix on Thursday (16 November), events are being depicted on screen that many of the public will remember well.\\n\\nThe first part of season six takes place in the summer of 1997, and sees Prince Charles (Dominic West) building on his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams), while Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) sparks up a romance with film producer Dodi Fayed (Khalid Abdalla). The show also features the pair’s death in a car crash in Paris.\\n\\nAs the new season arrives, and fans wonder what in The Crown is based in reality, here’s everything you need to know.\\n\\nDiana’s role with Tony Blair’s government\\n\\nEpisode one sees Diana visiting Tony (Bertie Carvel) and Cherie Blair (Lydia Leonard) with William after asking for a meeting with him. Recalling their discussion to the Queen, Blair says that Diana feels she “still has a lot to offer the country as a public servant”. He says that she had asked if there was a way to work with the government on “a more formal basis” and that any “official role” would be appreciated.\\n\\nBertie Carvel as Blair (Netflix)\\n\\nFollowing Diana’s death, Downing Street confirmed that Diana had visited Blair at Chequers with her son a few weeks before, where they discussed a special role for her as an overseas “ambassador” for Britain. Diana told a journalist at the time that the prime minister had recognised her skills and asked her to undertake “missions” abroad for Britain.\\n\\nQueen Elizabeth’s reluctance to accept Camilla\\n\\nAs The Crown season six begins, Charles is frustrated at the public for demonising Camilla long after his split from Diana. Asks the Queen if she’d received the invitation to Camilla’s 50th birthday, to which she says she has, but cannot attend as she’s in Derbyshire. When Charles points out that plans “can always be changed”, she replies: “Why would we want to change it?” She doesn’t attend, but later tells Prince Philip that she doesn’t want for Camilla to be considered “wicked, because she’s not” or to be unkind to her.\\n\\nCharles (West) hosts Camilla’s (Williams) birthday (Netflix)\\n\\nIt took a while for Queen Elizabeth and Camilla to grow close. According to historian Robert Lacey, she was reluctant to accept Charles’s request to be more accommodating to Camilla. Unlike in The Crown, she is said to have once referred to Camilla as “that wicked woman” to Charles’s face. However, she grew to become closer to Camilla. Despite announcing in 2005 that Camilla would become the Princess Consort rather than Queen Consort, it was announced that Camilla would be queen seven months before Elizabeth’s death.\\n\\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\\n\\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\\n\\nDodi Fayed’s engagement to an American model\\n\\nWhen viewers first meet Dodi in The Crown, he’s in Paris with a woman with short, blonde hair. However, it’s not Diana, but an American woman who he says he’s picking out fabric for a Malibu home with and says he’s marrying in three weeks. His father Mohamed is unimpressed, calling him to Saint Tropez to meet a “special guest” and leave his “gold-digger” fiance – who he also calls “Madame Bikini” – behind. The model later confronts Dodi, asking if he was with Diana when he leaves her to go see his father. Diana also alludes to a “lawsuit” between Dodi and his ex.\\n\\nDiana (Debicki) and Dodi (Abdalla) (PA)\\n\\nThis storyline comes to close to the truth as told by model Kelly Fisher, who claimed to have been engaged to Dodi when he met Diana. Fisher had previously modelled for brands such as Victoria’s Secret and magazines including Elle and Marie Claire. As in The Crown, Fisher – who met Fayed in July 1996 – was on another Fayed yacht when Dodi and Diana were first photographed. She staged a press conference where she announced that she was filing a breach-of-contract lawsuit against Dodi, after he allegedly asked her to stop modelling as much and prioritise the relationship. Through tears, she claimed that he had proposed to her (something his family denied) and promised to buy her a house in Malibu. However, she dropped the lawsuit following Dodi’s death.\\n\\nDiana’s close relationship with paparazzi on France yacht trip\\n\\nWhen Dodi and Diana first spend time together on his father’s yacht in France, the paparazzi are never far away. However, when William refuses to go outside until the photographers leave them alone, she takes a boat out to visit them. Wearing a swimming costume, she asks them: “We’re having a lovely time, apart from one little thing: you lot.” “Don’t be like that, you love us really,” they reply. Diana asks them to leave her alone as they’re “freaking out” her sons, before telling one photographer – who she knows by name – that if they go away, “you’re going to get a big surprise with the next thing I do”. She then poses for them in her swimsuit, but complains in a later episode that they can “never relax” with the press “constantly” around.\\n\\nDiana (Debicki) on the Fayed yacht (Daniel Escale/Netflix)\\n\\nFormer Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown, who wrote the controversial 2007 book Diana Chronicles, claimed that Diana would often tip off the press and “ couldn’t resist giving them the images they wanted”, including on the boat. Photographer Daniel Pirrie, who ended up selling the photo of the kiss, claimed that Diana herself invited him to photograph her on holiday with Dodi in France that summer. “She told me she’d be on the yacht somewhere in the Mediterranean,” he told The Daily Mail in 2013. “She let me know she was going to be on a tender going out to the yacht. I think overall, she was happy with all the pictures taken that summer… I knew that Diana had wanted [the kiss photo] to be taken.”\\n\\nMohamed al Fayed’s role in securing kiss photo\\n\\nThroughout season six, Mohamed al Fayed (Salim Daw) is shown as heavily invested in his son Dodi’s relationship with Diana, even ringing up the maid to ask if they have been “intimate”. In Arabic, he then asks his secretary if they can find him an Arabic photographer – “not just any idiot with a long lens”, but “the best photographer on the Meditarranean”.\\n\\nSalim Daw as Mohamed al Fayed (Netflix)\\n\\nIt’s not known whether Mohamed was so instrumental in securing the photo of Dodi and Diana kissing for the first time. However, following the Harrods owner’s death this year, biographer Tom Bower recalled in The Times how Al-Fayed “gleefully” showed him the photographs of Dodi and Diana and allegedly “revealed how he had rapidly bought a yacht suitable for his son’s seduction of her”.\\n\\nDodi’s proposal to Diana on the night they died\\n\\nAfter bursting into tears going for dinner at the Ritz, move upstairs, he proposes to her with a ring she had previously pointed out when they sheltered from crowds in a Monte Carlo jewellery shop. She tells him to get up off his knee “I know the whole world is wondering if we’re going to get married, but that’s not a reason to actually do it.” However, they share a drink and bittersweet conversation about how they need to live their lives going forward - advice\\n\\nDodi is shown proposing to Diana before they died (Daniel Escale/Netflix)\\n\\nIn real life, Dodi did not propose to Diana on that fateful evening in Paris. However, at the inquest into the death in 2007, the jury were shown CCTV footage of him purchasing an engagement ring worth £11,600 in a jewellers across the square from the Ritz on the afternoon of the crash. It was later believed to have been delivered to their room before they went to Dodi’s flat, where a ring bearing the words “Dis-moi Oui” (“Tell me Yes”) – also the name of episode three – was later recovered, alongside a receipt for a “bague de fiançaille” (engagement ring). Speaking at the inquest, his father Mohamed claimed that the pair had met the jeweller in Monte Carlo during the holiday on the yacht, and that he believed Dodi planned to propose that night.\\n\\nPrince William goes missing in Balmoral after Diana’s death\\n\\nAfter learning of Diana’s death from his father at the royal residence of Balmoral in Scotland, William (Rufus Kampa) is left heartbroken with grief and angry at his family’s response to it. At one point, Charles is informed that the prince is not in his room and that “no one can find him”, prompting Charles and Prince Harry to look for him and a subsequent hunt across the grounds for the young royal. He is not located, but later walks back to the house on his own accord, drenched in rain. “14 hours, that poor boy was gone,” the Queen later says.\\n\\nWilliam (Kampa) goes missing after his mother’s death (Keith Bernstein)\\n\\nIt’s true that William and Harry initially stayed in Balmoral with their grandmother following the death of Diana. While it’s not known whether he went missing, during a visit to Scotland in 2021, William recalled how that experience was one of the “saddest” moments of his life. “I was in Balmoral when I was told that my mother had died. Still in shock, I found sanctuary in the service at Crathie Kirk that very morning,” he recalled. “And in the dark days of grief that followed, I found comfort and solace in the Scottish outdoors. As a result, the connection I feel to Scotland will forever run deep.”\\n\\nThe Crown season six part one is on Netflix now, with part two arriving on 14 December.', 'As Halloween looms up ahead, a cohort of Connecticut moms has been rehearsing their dreadful dance moves and creating creepy costumes in preparation for an annual neighborhood performance on October 31 — all to raise money for breast cancer research.\\n\\n\"It’s a bonding experience,\" Kate Garin, 39, an accountant in Fairfield, Connecticut, told Fox News Digital.\\n\\n\"Many in our group are survivors,\" she said, \"so to be able to connect with women and share stories and have someone to turn to if, God forbid, this happens to you, it’s very touching.

The latest installment takes place between the late 1990s to mid-2000s, and includes the lead-up to Princess Diana’s fatal Paris car crash in 1997.\\n\\nThe season begins with Princess Diana (played by Elizabeth Debicki) whisking her sons - Prince William (played by Rufus Kampa) and Prince Harry (played by Fflyn Edwards) - away on summer holiday to Saint-Tropez, France. After staying several days on Mohamed Al Fayed’s yacht, the boys return home to London where their father, the then-Prince of Wales, accompanies them to Balmoral Castle to vacation with the rest of the royal family in Scotland.\\n\\nIn episode three, Diana’s partner Dodi Fayed (played by Khalid Abdalla) surprises her with a quick trip to Paris, France. However, the princess is keen to return home to the United Kingdom, and is eager to speak to her sons over the phone. A mob of paparazzi following the couple delays Diana’s scheduled phone call with William and Harry, until she’s able to catch them again later that evening.\\n\\nIt is in this scene that The Crown depicts the doting mother’s final conversation with her sons.\\n\\nWilliam, then 15, and Harry, then 12, inquire over the phone when their mother will be coming back home from Paris. “I’m coming home tomorrow, and I’m seeing you both tomorrow night,” Diana replies in the episode, which also takes place on the same day as her fatal car crash later that evening. The boys then ask Diana whether she plans on marrying Dodi, considering their relationship has been plastered all over the tabloids.\\n\\nDiana’s poignant last words to William and Harry shown in The Crown scene\\n\\n“Well, you know better than to believe the papers,” she tells William, before adding: “I’m emphatically not going to marry Dodi. To be honest, I can’t wait to come home.”\\n\\nWhen William sweetly asks his mother if she’s doing “okay”, Diana candidly tells her eldest son: “I’m okay. It’s just a bit mad here. I don’t really understand how I ended up here. Mummy just needs to make some changes to her life, that’s all. But that’s not your problem, that’s mine.”\\n\\nBefore saying their goodbyes, Diana reminds William and Harry that she will be seeing them the next day - although that day never comes. “I’ll see you both tomorrow night,” she says. “Just the three of us.”\\n\\nThe moment unsurprisingly tugged on the heartstrings of many viewers, who took to social media to share their thoughts on the devastating moment.\\n\\n“The last phone call between Harry, William and Diana broke my heart,” one fan wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\\n\\n“That precious phone call between Diana and her sons,” said someone else. “Don’t mind me, I’m just gonna cry in one corner.”\\n\\n“The last call between Harry, William and Diana is heartbreaking,” a third user commented.\\n\\nIn both the series and in real-life, Diana and Dodi - along with their chauffeur, Henri Paul - were killed on 31 August 1997 when their Mercedes-Benz was pursued by paparazzi and crashed in the Pont de l’Alma tunnel in Paris. The mother of two was 36 years old.\\n\\nThe fatal car crash was recreated in the very first scene of season six. While the incident is not shown on-screen, a car carrying Diana and Dodi is seen speeding past a man walking his dog, before entering the tunnel. As the vehicle’s horn blares, he calls emergency services on his cell phone.\\n\\nAustralian actor Elizabeth Debicki, who took over the role of Diana from Emma Corrin in season five, admitted it was “difficult to recreate” the scene - especially with her character being hounded by the paparazzi. “It was heavy and very manic, and incredibly invasive. And it had a kind of pressure to it,” Debicki said in an interview with Netflix.\\n\\n“At times it’s almost like an animalistic response to being pursued, by that many actors playing the press, because there’s nowhere you can go and you only have to be in a situation like that for about a minute, before you realise this is completely unbearable.”\\n\\nThe first four episodes of The Crown season six are available to stream on Netflix in the US and UK.', 'Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviews Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\\n\\nAs Netflix’s acclaimed royal drama moves closer to the present day, the line between fact and fiction feels ever more blurred.\\n\\nWhile Peter Morgan’s show has always presented a dramatised take on real-life events, many have argued that viewers struggle to tell the difference between the real royal family and the events on the show. When season five arrived last year, there were calls for the show to include a “fictional explainer” – something Netflix did not do.\\n\\nWith the show heading into the late Nineties and early Noughties in its final season, which arrived on Netflix on Thursday (16 November), events are being depicted on screen that many of the public will remember well.\\n\\nThe first part of season six takes place in the summer of 1997, and sees Prince Charles (Dominic West) building on his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams), while Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) sparks up a romance with film producer Dodi Fayed (Khalid Abdalla). The show also features the pair’s death in a car crash in Paris.\\n\\nAs the new season arrives, and fans wonder what in The Crown is based in reality, here’s everything you need to know.\\n\\nDiana’s role with Tony Blair’s government\\n\\nEpisode one sees Diana visiting Tony (Bertie Carvel) and Cherie Blair (Lydia Leonard) with William after asking for a meeting with him. Recalling their discussion to the Queen, Blair says that Diana feels she “still has a lot to offer the country as a public servant”. He says that she had asked if there was a way to work with the government on “a more formal basis” and that any “official role” would be appreciated.\\n\\nBertie Carvel as Blair (Netflix)\\n\\nFollowing Diana’s death, Downing Street confirmed that Diana had visited Blair at Chequers with her son a few weeks before, where they discussed a special role for her as an overseas “ambassador” for Britain. Diana told a journalist at the time that the prime minister had recognised her skills and asked her to undertake “missions” abroad for Britain.\\n\\nQueen Elizabeth’s reluctance to accept Camilla\\n\\nAs The Crown season six begins, Charles is frustrated at the public for demonising Camilla long after his split from Diana. Asks the Queen if she’d received the invitation to Camilla’s 50th birthday, to which she says she has, but cannot attend as she’s in Derbyshire. When Charles points out that plans “can always be changed”, she replies: “Why would we want to change it?” She doesn’t attend, but later tells Prince Philip that she doesn’t want for Camilla to be considered “wicked, because she’s not” or to be unkind to her.\\n\\nCharles (West) hosts Camilla’s (Williams) birthday (Netflix)\\n\\nIt took a while for Queen Elizabeth and Camilla to grow close. According to historian Robert Lacey, she was reluctant to accept Charles’s request to be more accommodating to Camilla. Unlike in The Crown, she is said to have once referred to Camilla as “that wicked woman” to Charles’s face. However, she grew to become closer to Camilla. Despite announcing in 2005 that Camilla would become the Princess Consort rather than Queen Consort, it was announced that Camilla would be queen seven months before Elizabeth’s death.\\n\\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\\n\\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\\n\\nDodi Fayed’s engagement to an American model\\n\\nWhen viewers first meet Dodi in The Crown, he’s in Paris with a woman with short, blonde hair. However, it’s not Diana, but an American woman who he says he’s picking out fabric for a Malibu home with and says he’s marrying in three weeks. His father Mohamed is unimpressed, calling him to Saint Tropez to meet a “special guest” and leave his “gold-digger” fiance – who he also calls “Madame Bikini” – behind. The model later confronts Dodi, asking if he was with Diana when he leaves her to go see his father. Diana also alludes to a “lawsuit” between Dodi and his ex.\\n\\nDiana (Debicki) and Dodi (Abdalla) (PA)\\n\\nThis storyline comes to close to the truth as told by model Kelly Fisher, who claimed to have been engaged to Dodi when he met Diana. Fisher had previously modelled for brands such as Victoria’s Secret and magazines including Elle and Marie Claire. As in The Crown, Fisher – who met Fayed in July 1996 – was on another Fayed yacht when Dodi and Diana were first photographed. She staged a press conference where she announced that she was filing a breach-of-contract lawsuit against Dodi, after he allegedly asked her to stop modelling as much and prioritise the relationship. Through tears, she claimed that he had proposed to her (something his family denied) and promised to buy her a house in Malibu. However, she dropped the lawsuit following Dodi’s death.\\n\\nDiana’s close relationship with paparazzi on France yacht trip\\n\\nWhen Dodi and Diana first spend time together on his father’s yacht in France, the paparazzi are never far away. However, when William refuses to go outside until the photographers leave them alone, she takes a boat out to visit them. Wearing a swimming costume, she asks them: “We’re having a lovely time, apart from one little thing: you lot.” “Don’t be like that, you love us really,” they reply. Diana asks them to leave her alone as they’re “freaking out” her sons, before telling one photographer – who she knows by name – that if they go away, “you’re going to get a big surprise with the next thing I do”. She then poses for them in her swimsuit, but complains in a later episode that they can “never relax” with the press “constantly” around.\\n\\nDiana (Debicki) on the Fayed yacht (Daniel Escale/Netflix)\\n\\nFormer Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown, who wrote the controversial 2007 book Diana Chronicles, claimed that Diana would often tip off the press and “ couldn’t resist giving them the images they wanted”, including on the boat. Photographer Daniel Pirrie, who ended up selling the photo of the kiss, claimed that Diana herself invited him to photograph her on holiday with Dodi in France that summer. “She told me she’d be on the yacht somewhere in the Mediterranean,” he told The Daily Mail in 2013. “She let me know she was going to be on a tender going out to the yacht. I think overall, she was happy with all the pictures taken that summer… I knew that Diana had wanted [the kiss photo] to be taken.”\\n\\nMohamed al Fayed’s role in securing kiss photo\\n\\nThroughout season six, Mohamed al Fayed (Salim Daw) is shown as heavily invested in his son Dodi’s relationship with Diana, even ringing up the maid to ask if they have been “intimate”. In Arabic, he then asks his secretary if they can find him an Arabic photographer – “not just any idiot with a long lens”, but “the best photographer on the Meditarranean”.\\n\\nSalim Daw as Mohamed al Fayed (Netflix)\\n\\nIt’s not known whether Mohamed was so instrumental in securing the photo of Dodi and Diana kissing for the first time. However, following the Harrods owner’s death this year, biographer Tom Bower recalled in The Times how Al-Fayed “gleefully” showed him the photographs of Dodi and Diana and allegedly “revealed how he had rapidly bought a yacht suitable for his son’s seduction of her”.\\n\\nDodi’s proposal to Diana on the night they died\\n\\nAfter bursting into tears going for dinner at the Ritz, move upstairs, he proposes to her with a ring she had previously pointed out when they sheltered from crowds in a Monte Carlo jewellery shop. She tells him to get up off his knee “I know the whole world is wondering if we’re going to get married, but that’s not a reason to actually do it.” However, they share a drink and bittersweet conversation about how they need to live their lives going forward - advice\\n\\nDodi is shown proposing to Diana before they died (Daniel Escale/Netflix)\\n\\nIn real life, Dodi did not propose to Diana on that fateful evening in Paris. However, at the inquest into the death in 2007, the jury were shown CCTV footage of him purchasing an engagement ring worth £11,600 in a jewellers across the square from the Ritz on the afternoon of the crash. It was later believed to have been delivered to their room before they went to Dodi’s flat, where a ring bearing the words “Dis-moi Oui” (“Tell me Yes”) – also the name of episode three – was later recovered, alongside a receipt for a “bague de fiançaille” (engagement ring). Speaking at the inquest, his father Mohamed claimed that the pair had met the jeweller in Monte Carlo during the holiday on the yacht, and that he believed Dodi planned to propose that night.\\n\\nPrince William goes missing in Balmoral after Diana’s death\\n\\nAfter learning of Diana’s death from his father at the royal residence of Balmoral in Scotland, William (Rufus Kampa) is left heartbroken with grief and angry at his family’s response to it. At one point, Charles is informed that the prince is not in his room and that “no one can find him”, prompting Charles and Prince Harry to look for him and a subsequent hunt across the grounds for the young royal. He is not located, but later walks back to the house on his own accord, drenched in rain. “14 hours, that poor boy was gone,” the Queen later says.\\n\\nWilliam (Kampa) goes missing after his mother’s death (Keith Bernstein)\\n\\nIt’s true that William and Harry initially stayed in Balmoral with their grandmother following the death of Diana. While it’s not known whether he went missing, during a visit to Scotland in 2021, William recalled how that experience was one of the “saddest” moments of his life. “I was in Balmoral when I was told that my mother had died. Still in shock, I found sanctuary in the service at Crathie Kirk that very morning,” he recalled. “And in the dark days of grief that followed, I found comfort and solace in the Scottish outdoors. As a result, the connection I feel to Scotland will forever run deep.”\\n\\nThe Crown season six part one is on Netflix now, with part two arriving on 14 December.', 'As Halloween looms up ahead, a cohort of Connecticut moms has been rehearsing their dreadful dance moves and creating creepy costumes in preparation for an annual neighborhood performance on October 31 — all to raise money for breast cancer research.\\n\\n\"It’s a bonding experience,\" Kate Garin, 39, an accountant in Fairfield, Connecticut, told Fox News Digital.\\n\\n\"Many in our group are survivors,\" she said, \"so to be able to connect with women and share stories and have someone to turn to if, God forbid, this happens to you, it’s very touching.
